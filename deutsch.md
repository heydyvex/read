## The Fabric Of Reality 
I read this book along with Brett Hall on his youtube channel, so I might add things that is from Brett.

#### 1 - The Theory of Everything

###### Understanding
- understanding the fabric of reality doesn’t require to understand every single mere-known facts, but having the right **concept, explanations and theories**. 
- predicting and describing things is not the same thing as understanding them. things can be understood only by being explained.
- a theory is about explanation and prediction is merely some of the consequences that we can deduce from the explanation.
- scientific theories explain the object and phenomena that we of our experience in terms of an underlying reality which we do not experience directly, But the ability of a theory to explain what we experience is not its most valuable attribute. Its most valuable attribute is that it explains the fabric of reality itself.
- one of the most valuable, significant and also useful attributes of human thought generally is its ability to reveal and explain the fabric of reality.
###### Instrumentalism
- some philosophers and even some scientist disparage the role of explanation in science, to them the basic purpose of a scientific theory is not to explain anything. but to predict the outcomes of experiments.
- Instrumentalism says that a theory is no more than an 'Instrument' for making predictions and that science can enable us to understand the underlying reality is a fallacy and explanation beyond prediction are empty words.
###### Positivism , Logical positivism
- Positivism, an extreme form of instrumentalism holds that all statements than those describing or predicting observations are not only superfluous but meaningless.
- On reason that instrumentalist and positivist ideas are plausible is that, although prediction is not the purpose of science, it is part of the characteristic method of science. the scientific method involves postulating a new theory to explain some class of phenomena and then performing a **crucial experimental test**. in an experiment if one theory predict one observable outcome and new theory another, one rejects the theory whose predictions turns out to be false, So the outcome of a crucial experimental test decides between two theories does depend on their prediction not their explanation, this is the source of misconception. majority of theories are rejected because they contain bad explanations, not because they fail experimental tests.
###### Explanation 
- the real purpose of science is to explain the world.(Indeed)
- it is hard to give a precise definition of 'explanation' or 'understanding'.  they are about 'why' rather than 'what'; about the inner workings of things; about how things really are, not just how they appear to be; about what must be so, rather than what merely happens to be so; about laws of nature rather than rules of thumb.
- Brett: "One reason we can’t give strict definition to explanations is we have to allow for new modes of explanations, to allow our definition of explanation to be elastic and allow new modes of explanations to be invented in the future". (Read the beginning of infinity)
