# Notes on David Deutsch's Ideas

## The Fabric Of Reality 
I read this book along with Brett Hall on his youtube channel, so I might add things that is from Brett.

### Chapter 1 - The Theory of Everything
"since I was a child I wanted to understand everything that was understood"
(I modified it a little:))
##### Understanding and explanation
- "understanding the fabric of reality doesn’t require to understand every single mere-known facts, but having the right **concept, explanations and theories**."
- "predicting and describing things is not the same thing as understanding them. things can be understood only by being explained."
- "a theory is about explanation and prediction is merely some of the consequences that we can deduce from the explanation."
- "scientific theories explain the object and phenomena that we of our experience in terms of an underlying reality which we do not experience directly, But the ability of a theory to explain what we experience is not its most valuable attribute. Its most valuable attribute is that it explains the fabric of reality itself."
- "one of the most valuable, significant and also useful attributes of human thought generally is its ability to reveal and explain the fabric of reality."
##### Instrumentalism
- "some philosophers and even some scientist disparage the role of explanation in science, to them the basic purpose of a scientific theory is not to explain anything. but to predict the outcomes of experiments."
- "Instrumentalism says that a theory is no more than an 'Instrument' for making predictions and that science can enable us to understand the underlying reality is a fallacy and explanation beyond prediction are empty words."
##### Positivism , Logical positivism
- "Positivism, an extreme form of instrumentalism holds that all statements than those describing or predicting observations are not only superfluous but meaningless."
- "On reason that instrumentalist and positivist ideas are plausible is that, although prediction is not the purpose of science, it is part of the characteristic method of science. the scientific method involves postulating a new theory to explain some class of phenomena and then performing a **crucial experimental test**. in an experiment if one theory predict one observable outcome and new theory another, one rejects the theory whose predictions turns out to be false, So the outcome of a crucial experimental test decides between two theories does depend on their prediction not their explanation, this is the source of misconception. majority of theories are rejected because they contain bad explanations, not because they fail experimental tests."
##### Explanation 
- "the real purpose of science is to **explain** the world."
- "it is hard to give a precise definition of 'explanation' or 'understanding'.  they are about 'why' rather than 'what'; about the inner workings of things; about how things really are, not just how they appear to be; about what must be so, rather than what merely happens to be so; about laws of nature rather than rules of thumb."
- Brett : "One reason we can’t give strict definition to explanations is we have to allow for new modes of explanations, to allow our definition of explanation to be elastic and allow new modes of explanations to be invented in the future". (Read the beginning of infinity)
- "Explanations are also about coherence, elegance and simplicity, as opposed to arbitrariness and complexity, though none of those things is easy to define either."
- "Prediction – even perfect, universal prediction – is simply no substitute for explanation."
- "Understanding is one of the higher functions of the human mind and brain, and a unique one. Many other physical systems, such as animals' brains, computers and other machines, can assimi­late facts and act upon them. But at present we know of nothing that is capable of understanding an explanation or of wanting one in the first place other than a human mind. Every discovery of a new explanation, and every act of grasping an existing expla­nation, depends on the uniquely human faculty of creative thought."

##### Theory of Everything
- "the issue of whether it is becoming harder or easier to understand everything that is understood depends o the overall balance between these two opposing effects of the growth of know­ledge: the increasing **breadth** of our theories, and their increasing **depth**. **Breadth makes it harder; depth makes it easier**. One thesis of this book is that, slowly but surely, depth is winning."
- "We are not heading away from a state in which one person could understand everything that is understood, but towards it."
- "It is not that we shall soon understand everything. That is a completely different issue. I do not believe that we are now, or ever shall be, close to understanding **everything there is**. What I am discussing is the possibility of understanding **everything that is understood**. this depend on structure of our knowledge and if the fabric of reality is itself highly unified"
- "understanding everything that is understood depends on structure of knowledge and structure of knowledge depends on what the fabric of reality as a whole is like. if fabric of reality is itself highly unified, eventually our theories will become so general, deep and integrated with one another that they will become a single theory of a unified fabric of reality. This theory will still not explain every aspect of reality: that is unattainable. But it will encompass all known explanations, and will apply to the whole fabric of reality in so far as it is understood. Whereas all previous theories related to particular subjects, this will be a theory of all subjects: **a Theory of Everything**. it will not be the last such theory only the first and we expect them to be superseded by deeper, more accurate theories."
- "in science even our best theories are bound to be imperfect and problematic. humans are fallible."
- "Deutsch's theory of everything is different from some particle physicists's theory of everything that they hope they will achieve some day, Their 'theory of everything' would be a unified theory of all the basic forces known to physics, namely gravity, electromagnetism and nuclear forces.(this narrow ToE is motivated by bad and mistaken view of the nature of science namely reductionism). this ToE only provide a tiny facet of Real ToE."

##### Reductionism, Holism
- "reductionism is a view that scientific explanations are inherently reductive. and reductive is one that works by analyzing things into lower-level components. and consists of analyzing a system into smaller and simpler systems."
- "Holism, the idea that the only legitimate explanations are in terms of higher-level systems; the opposite of reductionism."
- "A reductionist thinks that science is about analyzing things into components. An instrumentalist thinks that it is about predicting things."
- "reductionism assumes that all explanation is of later events in terms of earlier events; in other words, that the only way of explaining something is to state its causes. And this implies that the earlier the events in terms of which we explain something, the better the explanation, so that ultimately the best explanations of all are in terms of the initial state of the universe."
##### emergence, emergent phenomena
- "emergence: high-level simplicity 'emerges' from low-level complexity. High-level phenomena about which there are comprehensible facts that are not simply deducible from lower-level theories are called emergent phenomena. and they need to understood in their own terms and at that level not at the level of physics."
- "emergence: An emergent phenomenon is one (such as life, thought or computation) about which there are comprehensible facts or explanations that are not simply deducible from lower-level theories, but which may be explicable or predictable by higher­-level theories referring directly to that phenomenon."
- "Complexity prevents us from using fundamental physics to make high-level predictions, so instead we guess what those predictions would be if we could make them -- emergence gives us a chance of doing that successfully -- and suppos­edly that is what the higher-level sciences are about."
- An example for the importance of emergent explanations: 
  "For example, consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low­ level physical observation - the presence of a copper atom at a particular location - through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. 
  There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive 'theory of everything' would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor's studio, and so on. They could also state how those trajectories were influenced by forces exerted by surrounding atoms, such as those comprising the miners' and sculptor's bodies, and so predict the existence and shape of the statue. In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom's being there, you would still not be able to say, 'Ah yes, now I understand why it is there.' You would merely know that its arrival there in that way was inevitable (or likely, or whatever), given all the atoms' initial configurations and the laws of physics. I f you wanted to understand why, you would still have no option but to take a further step. You would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing this inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to dis­ cover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenom­ena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand fully why that copper atom is where it is."
##### Four main strands of Deutsch's theory of everything
- 1 - Quantum theory also Everettian Quantum theory 
- 2 - Epistemology(Theory of Knowledge): The study of the nature of knowledge and the processes that create it.
- 3 - Theory of Computation
- 4 - Theory of evolution
- "The fabric of reality does not consist only of reductionist ingredients like space, time and subatomic particles, but also of life, thought, computation and the other things to which those explanations refer."

### Chapter 2 - Shadow

##### Prerequisites 
-  "the arguments I have presented in this chapter are compelling only to those who seek explanations."
- "Those who are satisfied with mere prediction, and who have no strong desire to understand how the predicted outcomes of experi­ments come about, may if they wish simply deny the existence of anything other than what I have been calling 'tangible' entities(deny multiverse)."
- "understanding the multiverse is a precondition for understand­ing reality as best we can."
- read this chapter of book, I can’t articulate what David explained.
##### Quantum theory
**everything** in the universe like water, light, gold (matter in general)etc... are made of smallest possible unit called quantum(plural quanta) and are not continuous. in short everything is quantized and Quantum theory gets its name from this property. 
Quantum theory is about studying and understanding quanta, the smallest possible unit(such as particles) and multiverse.
##### Light
light for example comes in packets, the smallest possible unit of light called **photon**, particle of light. apparently beam of light looks continuous because every second it pours about $10^{14}$ (a hundred trillion) pho­tons into an eye that looks into it.

Look at this image:
![narrow beam](/assets/narrow%20beam.png)
*source: the fabric of reality*

Light instead of passing through the holes in straight lines it refuses to confined and spreads out after each holes and as it sprays it frays.
but light is made of photons and photons are particle, so this is unexpected.

And this is the pattern of light and shadow formed by light after passing through a small circular hole:
![](/assets/circular%20hole.png)
*source: the fabric of reality*

there is nothing happening here but the casting of a shadow. this what would look like when light passes the second screen from previous image..
If light travelled only in straight line, there would only be a tiny white dote(smaller than white spot in image)
##### Double-slit experiment
this experiment makes most physicists get crazy and confused.(and quantum theory in general:))
this is how it works: light passes through **double tiny slits** and a barrier cast a very strange shadow:
![](/assets/double%20slit%20experiment.jpg)

and this is more explanatory image of shadows:
![](/assets/double%20slit.png)
but why would a light passing through two straight parallel slits cast a shadow like this and not just a pair of bright band?

Now what if we have four straight parallel slits?:
![](/assets/double%20slit%20vs%20four%20slit.png)
as figure shows, 4 slits pattern cast more complicated pattern.

something must be coming through that second pair of slits to prevent the light from the first pair from reaching X, but what?
whatever that causes the **interference** is in the light beam.
##### Single-particle double slit experiment
What should we expect to happen when these experiments are performed with only one photon at a time?
![](/assets/single%20particle%20double%20slit.png)
"So, if the photons do not split into fragments, and are not being deflected by other photons, what does deflect them? When a single photon at a time is passing through the apparatus, what can be coming through the other slits to interfere with it?"
"We have found that when one photon passes through this apparatus,  
it passes through one of the slits, and then something interferes with it, deflecting it in a way that depends on what other slits are open;
the interfering entities have passed through some of the other slits;
the interfering entities behave exactly like photons . . .  
. . . except that they cannot be seen."

Bingo! that is right!
**turns out photons from other universes interfere with photons from our universe and make interference pattern**
photons of our universe are called *tangible* photons, and photons of other universes are called *shadow* photons.
Tangible photons are the ones we can see or detect with devices, whereas the shadow photons are intangible(invisible) and detectable only indirectly through their interference effect on the tangible photons.

Interference: is something affecting that light that would have struck X but which didn’t. 
In other words interference is photon that are visible colliding with photon that are invisible, these photon that cannot be seen push aside the photons that you can see, because if they weren’t there, then the photon would’ve just continued off through that double-slit and landed behind on of those two slits.

At least a trillion shadow photons accompanying each tangible one.
"Thus we have inferred the existence of a seething, prodigiously complicated, hidden world of shadow photons. They travel at the speed of light, bounce off mirrors, are refracted by lenses, and are stopped by opaque barriers or filters of the wrong colour. Yet they do not trigger even the most sensitive detectors. The only thing in the universe that a shadow photon can be observed to affect is the tangible photon that it accompanies. That is the phenomenon of interference. Shadow photons would go entirely unnoticed were it not for this phenomenon and the strange patterns of shadows by which we observe it."

And Interference is not only for photons, it occurs for every sort of particle, so there must be hosts of shadow neutrons accom­panying every tangible neutron, hosts of shadow electrons accompanying every electron, and so on. Each of these shadow particles is detectable only indirectly, through its interference with the motion of its tangible counterpart.
##### Multiverse 
Reality is much bigger than it seems and most of it is invisible.
Every shadow photon in this universe is tangible in parallel universes(its own universe) and there are nearly infinite universe out there. there exist many version of me and you in parallel universes that are doing something else or writing and reading this note that I am taking from David's book.
And the whole universe(all parallel universes) are obeying the same laws of physics.

**For more detail read the chapter 2: shadows**

### Chapter 3 - Problem-solving 

##### What justifies these inferences?
*warning: justify is this context doesn’t mean justification, meaning demonstrating the truth, but in this context David by word justify means "as an indication of methodologically or morally right thing to do."*

- "I do not know which is stranger - the behavior of shadows itself, or the fact that contemplating a few patterns of light and shadow can force us to revise so radically our conception of the structure of reality."
- "What justifies these inferences? Can we be sure that just because a star appeared millimetrically displaced on Eddington's photo­ graphic plate, space and time must be curved; or that because a photodetector at a certain position does not register a 'hit' in weak light, there must be parallel universes?"
- "There is no getting away from the fact that we human beings are small creatures with only a few inaccurate, incomplete channels through which we receive all information from outside ourselves. We interpret this infor­mation as evidence of a large and complex external universe (or multiverse). But when we are weighing up this evidence, we are literally contemplating nothing more than patterns of weak electric current trickling through our own brains."
- "What justifies the inferences we draw from these patterns? It is certainly not a matter of logical deduction. There is no way of *proving* from these or from any other observations that the external universe, or multiverse, exists at all, let alone that the electric currents received by our brains stand in any particular relationship to it."

##### Solipsism
- "Anything or everything that we perceive might be an illusion or a dream. Illusions and dreams are, after all, common. **Solipsism**, the theory that only one mind exists and that what appears to be external reality is only a dream taking place in that mind, cannot be logically disproved."
- "Since solipsism, and an infinity of related theories, are logically consistent with your perceiving any possible observational evidence, it follows that you can logically deduce nothing about reality from observational evidence. How, then, could I say that the observed behavior of shadows 'rules out' the theory that there is only one universe, or that eclipse observations make the Newtonian world-view 'rationally untenable'? How can that be so? If 'ruling out' does not mean 'disproving', what does it mean? Why should we feel compelled to change our world-view, or indeed any opinion at all, on account of something being 'ruled out' in that sense?"
- "This critique seems to cast doubt on the whole of science - on any reasoning about external reality that appeals to observational evi­dence. If scientific reasoning does not amount to sequences of logi­cal deductions from the evidence, what does it amount to? Why should we accept its conclusions? This is known as the **'problem of induction'.**"

##### Induction
*note: mathematical induction is not the same as induction in philosophy of science, and there is nothing wrong with it.*

- it was for most of the history of science, the prevailing theory of *how science works.* The theory was that there exists, short of mathematical proof, a lesser but still worthy form of justification called induction.
- "In the inductivist theory of scientific knowledge, observations play two roles: first, in the discovery of scientific theories, and second, in their justification. A theory is supposed to be discovered by 'extrapolating' or 'generalizing' the results of observations. Then, if large numbers of observations conform to the theory, and none deviates from it, the theory is supposed to be justified - made more believable, probable or reliable."

![](/assets/inductivist%20scheme.png)
*inductivist scheme*

- "The inductivist analysis of my discussion of shadows would therefore go something like this: 'We make a series of observations of shadows, and see interference phenomena (stage 1). The results conform to what would be expected if there existed parallel uni­verses which affect one another in certain ways. But at first no one notices this. Eventually (stage 2) someone forms the generalization that interference will always be observed under the given circum­stances, and thereby induces the theory that parallel universes are responsible. With every further observation of interference (stage 3) we become a little more convinced of that theory. After a suf­ficiently long sequence of such observations, and provided that none of them ever contradicts the theory, we conclude (stage 4) that the theory is true. Although we can never be absolutely sure, we are for practical purposes convinced.'"
- "It is hard to know where to begin in criticizing the inductivist conception of science, it is so profoundly false in so many different ways. Perhaps the worst flaw, from my point of view, is the sheer non sequitur that a generalized prediction is tantamount to a new theory. Like all scientific theories of any depth, the theory that there are parallel universes simply does not have the form of a generalization from the observations. Did we observe first one uni­ verse, then a second and a third, and then induce that there are trillions of them? Was the generalization that planets will 'wander' round the sky in one pattern rather than another, equivalent to the theory that planets are worlds, in orbit round the Sun, and that the Earth is one of them?"
- " It is also not true that repeating our observations is the way in which we become convinced of scientific theories. As I have said, theories are explanations, not merely pre­dictions. If one does not accept a proposed explanation of a set of observations, making the observations over and over again is sel­dom the remedy. Still less can it help us to create a satisfactory explanation when we cannot think of one at all."
##### Bertrand Russell's chicken story, inductivism is false:
- "The chicken noticed that the farmer came every day to feed it. It predicted that the farmer would continue to bring food every day. Inductivists think that the chicken had 'extrapolated' its observations into a theory, and that each feeding time added justification to that theory. Then one day the farmer came and wrung the chicken's neck."
- David on chicken story: 
  "The disappointment experienced by Russell's chicken has also been experienced by trillions of other chickens. This inductively justifies the conclusion that induction cannot justify any conclusions!
  However, this line of criticism lets inductivism off far too lightly. It does illustrate the fact that repeated observations cannot justify theories, but in doing so it entirely misses (or rather, accepts) a more basic misconception: namely, that the inductive extrapolation of observations to form new theories is even possible. In fact, it is impossible to extrapolate observations unless one has already placed them within an explanatory framework. For example, in order to 'induce' its false prediction, Russell's chicken must first have had in mind a false explanation of the farmer's behavior. Perhaps it guessed that the farmer harbored benevolent feelings towards chickens. Had it guessed a different explanation - that the farmer was trying to fatten the chickens up for slaughter, for instance - it would have 'extrapolated' the behavior differently. Suppose that one day the farmer starts bringing the chickens more food than usual. How one extrapolates this new set of observations to predict the farmer's future behavior depends entirely on how one explains it. According to the benevolent-farmer theory, it is evidence that the farmer's benevolence towards chickens has increased, and that therefore the chickens have even less to worry about than before. But according to the fattening-up theory, the behavior is ominous - it is evidence that slaughter is imminent."
- "Admittedly, inductivism is based on the common-sense theory of the growth of knowledge - that we learn from experience - and historically **it was associated with the liberation of science from dogma and tyranny**. **But if we want to understand the true nature of knowledge, and its place in the fabric of reality, we must face up to the fact that inductivism is false, root and branch. No scientific reasoning, and indeed no successful reasoning of any kind, has ever fitted the inductivist description**."

##### What now? a better theory for scientific discovery and knowledge, Karl Popper, Problem-solving 
- With all these inductivism and other prediction-centered theories of knowledge that are based on a misconception, what then is the pattern of scientific reasoning and discovery? we need a better and explanation-centered theory of knowledge, a theory of how explanations come into begin and how they are justified.
- Karl Popper's theory of knowledge and scientific discovery, regards science(and knowledge) as a ***problem-solving*** process, Inductivism regards the catalogue of the past observations as a sort of skeletal theory, supposing that science is all about filling in the gaps in that theory by interpolation and extrapolation.
- **Problem-solving process begin with an inadequate theory, it begins with our best existing theories. when some of those theories seem inadequate, we want new one, that is what constitutes a problem.** contrary to the inductivist scheme scien­tific discovery need not begin with observational evidence. But it does always begin with a problem.
- A problem does not necessarily mean a practical emergency or source of anxiety, it can be a set of ideas that seems inadequate and try to improve them. existing theory may seem glib, labored or unnecessarily narrow or it may be that there have been some surprising observations which existing theories did not predict and cannot explain. "This last type of problem resembles stage 1 of the inductivist scheme, but only superficially. For an unexpected observation never initiates a scientific discovery unless the pre-existing theories already contain the seeds of the problem.", (observation is theory-laden)

![](/assets/problem-solving%20process.png)
*universal scheme of problem-solving process. applies to all problem-solving, whatever the subject matter*

- "One solves a problem by finding new or amended theories, con­taining explanations which do not have the deficiencies, but do retain the merits, of existing explanations (Figure 3.2). Thus, after a problem presents itself (stage 1), the 11ext stage always involves conjecture: proposing new theories, or modifying or reinterpreting old ones, in the hope of solving the problem (stage 2). The conjec­tures are then criticized which, if the criticism is rational, entails examining and comparing them to see which offers the best expla­nations, according to the criteria inherent in the problem (stage 3). When a conjectured theory fails to survive criticism - chat is, when it appears to offer worse explanations than other theories do - it is abandoned. If we find ourselves abandoning one of our originally held theories in favour of one of the newly proposed ones (stage 4), we tentatively deem our problem-solving enterprise to have made progress. I say 'tentatively', because subsequent problem­ solving will probably involve altering or replacing even these new, apparently satisfactory theories, and sometimes even resurrecting some of the apparently unsatisfactory ones. Thus the solution, however good, is not the end of the story: it is a starting-point for the next problem-solving process (stage 5)."
-  "**A good explanation may make good predictions about the future, but the one thing that no explanation can even begin to predict is the content or quality of its own future rivals**."

![](/assets/scientific%20discovery%20process.png)
*the course of scientific discovery,  scientific discovery scheme*

- "Scientific problem-solving always includes a particular method of rational criticism, namely ***experimental testing***. Where two or more rival theories make conflicting predictions about the outcome of an experiment, the experiment is performed and the theory or theories that made false predictions are abandoned. The very construction of scientific conjectures is focused on finding explanations that have experimentally testable predictions. Ideally we are always seeking crucial experimental tests - experiments whose outcomes, whatever they are, will falsify one or more of the contending theories."
- "That is why there is a methodological rule in science which says that once an experimentally testable theory has passed the appropriate tests, any *less* testable rival theories about the same phenomena are summarily rejected, for their explanations are bound to be inferior. ***This rule is often cited as distinguishing science from other types of knowledge-creation.***"
- "But if we take the view that science is about explanations, we see that this rule is really a special case of something that applies naturally to all problem-solving: ***theories that are capable of giving more detailed explanations are automatically preferred***.
  They are preferred for two reasons. One is that a theory that 'sticks its neck out' by being more specific about more phenomena opens up itself and its rivals to more forms of criticism, and therefore has more chance of taking the problem-solving process forward. The second is simply that, if such a theory survives the criticism, it leaves less unexplained - which is the object of the exercise."
- experimental test does not confirm and therefore justify a theory as to be the truth, it just corroborate the theory and doesn’t refute it, the main point of experimental test is to be able to refute the theory not to confirm and justify it.
- there is also constant backtracking, in some situations explanation doesn’t fit to the problem and problem need to change, or criticism fails and need to change the proposed solution and so on...
- and just the reminder that observation, perception and evidence all are theory-laden and all being interpreted by your mind. **before we even make an observation, we decide carefully where and when we should look and what we should look for**. our theoretical backgrounds and existing knowledge influence what we observe, how we perceive it, and how we interpret evidence.
- the whole problem-solving process take much amount of creativity and scientific discovery beside creativity, take so much time

##### Evolutionary epistemology 
- Popper's theory of growth of knowledge(problem-solving process) follow a process analogous to biological evolution, and this is why popper called his theory an evolutionary epistemology.
- all theories are being subjected to *variation* and *selection*, according to criteria which are themselves subject to variation and selection, and whole process resembles biological evolution.
- "A problem is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche. Variants of theories, like genetic mutations, are continually being created, and less successful variants become extinct when more successful variants take over. 'Success' is the ability to survive repeatedly under the selective pressures - criticism - brought to bear in that niche, and the criteria for that criticism depend partly on the physical characteristics of the niche and partly on the attri­butes of other genes and species (i.e. other ideas) that are already present there. The new world-view that may be implicit in a theory that solves a problem, and the distinctive features of a new species that takes over a niche, are *emergent* properties of the problem or niche. In other words, obtaining solutions is inherently complex. There is no simple way of discovering the true nature of planets, given (say) a critique of the celestial-sphere theory and some additional observations, just as there is no simple way of designing the DNA of a koala bear, given the properties of eucalyptus trees. Evolution, or trial and error - especially the focused, purposeful form of trial and error called scientific discovery - are the only ways."
- although there are important differences, one difference is that in biology vari­ations (mutations) are random, blind and purposeless, while in human problem-solving the creation of new conjectures is itself a complex, knowledge-laden process driven by the intentions of the people concerned.  Perhaps an even more important difference is that there is no biological equivalent of argument. All conjectures have t o b e tested experimentally, which i s one reason why biologi­cal evolution is slower and less efficient by an astronomically large factor.
- Both in science and in biological evolution, evolutionary success depends on the creation and survival of *objective knowledge*, which in biology is called *adaptation*. That is, **the ability of a theory or gene to survive in a niche is not a haphazard function of its structure but depends on whether enough true and useful information about the niche is implicitly or explicitly encoded there**.
- Evolution and Creativity(focused, purposeful form of trial and error that humans are capable of) are the only ways of solving problems hence creating knowledge.

##### Inductivism vs Science
- Inductivism is observation- and prediction-based, whereas in reality science is problem- and explanation-based.
- Inductivism supposes that theories are somehow extracted or distilled from observations, or are justified by them, whereas in fact theories begin as unjustified conjectures in someone's mind, which typically precede the observa­tions that rule out rival theories.
-  Inductivism seeks to justify predic­tions as likely to hold in the future. Problem-solving justifies an explanation as being better than other explanations available in the present.
- Inductivism is a dangerous and recurring source of many sorts of error, because it is superficially so plausible. But it is not true.
- When we succeed in solving a problem, scientific or otherwise, we end up with a set of theories which, though they arc not problem-free, we find preferable to the theories we started with. what new attributes the new theories will have therefore depends on what we saw as the deficiencies in our original theories, that is, on what the problem was.
- The problem in genuine science is always to understand some aspect of the fabric of reality, by finding expla­nations that are as broad and deep, and as true and specific, as possible.
- When we think that we have solved a problem, we naturally adopt our new set of theories in preference to the old set. That is why science, regarded as explanation-seeking and problem-solving, raises no 'problem of induction'. There is no mystery about why we should feel compelled tentatively to accept an explanation when it is the best explanation we can think of.

### Chapter 4 - Criteria for Reality
"problems and explanations are located within the human mind, which owes its reasoning power to a fallible brain, and its supply of information to fallible senses, **What, then, entitles a human mind to draw conclusions about objective, external reality from its own purely subjective experience and reason?**"

"**realism**, the common sense view that an external physical universe really does exist and does affect our senses, including senses enhanced by instruments such as telescopes."
##### Galileo Galilei
- Galileo, great physicist and arguably the first physicist in the modern sense, apart from many discovery he made in physics itself but he also did in the methodology of science.
- "He revived the ancient idea of expressing general theories about nature in mathematical form, and improved upon it by developing the method of systematic experimental testing, which characterizes science as we know it. He aptly called such tests *cimenti*, or 'ordeals'. He was one of the first to use telescopes to study celestial objects, and he collected and analyzed evidence for the heliocentric theory, the theory that the Earth moves in orbit around the Sun and spins about its own axis."
- he is known for his advocacy of heliocentric theory and for the  bitter conflict with the Church into which that advocacy brought him. in 1633 the Inquisition tried him for heresy, and forced him under the threat of torture to kneel and read aloud a long, abject recantation saying that he 'abjured, cursed and detested' the theory and was convicted and sentenced to house arrest under which eh remained for the rest of his life.
- but effect of trial had far-reaching consequences, the real dispute wasn’t about layout of solar system, it was about Galileo's brilliant advocacy of a new and dangerous way of thinking about reality. not about the existence of reality(both Church and Galileo believed in realism, common sense view that an external physical universe really exist and affect our senses),
  "Where Galileo differed was in his conception of the relationship between physical reality on the one hand, and human ideas, observations and reason on the other. He believed that the universe could be understood in terms of universal, mathematically formulated laws, and that reliable knowledge of these laws was accessible to human beings if they applied his method of mathematical formulation and systematic experimental testing. As he put it, 'the Book of Nature is written in mathematical symbols'. This was in conscious comparison with that other Book on which it was more conventional to rely."
- "**Galileo understood that if his method was indeed reliable, then wherever it was applicable its conclusions had to be preferable to those obtained by any other method. Therefore he insisted that scientific reasoning took precedence not only over intuition and common sense, but also over religious doctrine and revelation. It was specifically that idea, and not the heliocentric theory as such, that the authorities considered dangerous. (And they were right, for if any idea can be said to have initiated the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, and to have provided the secular foundation of modern civilization, it is that one.)**"
- By the way, it was forbidden to 'hold or defend' the heliocentric theory as an  an explanation of the appearance of the night sky, but using, writing about it, holding it as a mathematical supposition or defending it as a method of making predictions were all permitted.
##### Galileo and the Inquisition
- the fact is in Galileo’s time it was not yet indisputable that the heliocentric theory gave better predictions that the geocentric theory. the available observation were not very accurate. Ad hoc modifications had been proposed to improve the accuracy of the geocentric theory, and it was hard to quantify the predictive powers of the two rival theories.
- Galileo believed that the planets move in circles, while in fact their orbits are very nearly ellipses, so the data did not fit the particular heliocentric theory that Galileo was defending either.
- "Church took no position in this controversy. The Inquisition did not care where the planets *appeared* to be; what they cared about was reality. They cared where the planets really were, and they wanted to understand the planets through explanations, just as Galileo did. Instrumentalists and positivists would say that since the Church was perfectly willing to accept Galileo's observational predictions, further argument between them was pointless, and that his muttering 'eppur si muove' was strictly meaningless. But Galileo knew better, and so did the Inquisition. When they denied the reliability of scientific knowledge, it was precisely the explanatory part of that knowledge that they had in mind."
- "So how can we defend Galileo against the Inquisition? What should Galileo's defense have been in the face of this charge of claiming too much when he claimed that scientific theories contain reliable knowledge of reality ? The Popperian defense of science as a process of problem-solving and explanation-seeking is not sufficient in itself. For the Church too was primarily interested in explanations and not predictions, and it was quite willing to let Galileo solve problems using any theory he chose. It was just that they did not accept that Galileo's solutions (which they would call mere ' mathematical hypotheses') had any bearing on external reality."
- "**Problem-solving, after all , is a process that takes place entirely within human minds.** Galileo may have seen the world as a book in which the laws of nature are written in mathematical symbols. But that is strictly a metaphor; there are no explanations in orbit out there with the planets. **The fact is that all our problems and solutions are located within ourselves, having been created by ourselves. When we solve problems in science we arrive through argument at theories whose explanations seem best to us.**"
- "the Inquisition and modern skeptics might legitimately ask what scientific problem-solving has to do with reality. We may find our 'best explanations' psychologically satisfying. We may find them helpful in -making predictions. We certainly find them essential in every area of technological creativity. All this does justify our continuing to seek them and to use them i n those ways. But why should we be obliged to take them as fact?"
- "if making the right predictions were our only constraint, we could invent theories which say that anything we please is going on in space. For example, **observations alone can never rule out the theory that the Earth is enclosed in a giant planetarium showing us a simulation of a heliocentric solar system; and that outside the planetarium there is anything you like, or nothing at all.**"
##### Solipsism and Boundary for Reality
- "the Inquisition were realists. Yet their theory has this in common with solipsism: both of them draw an arbitrary boundary beyond which, they claim, human reason has no access or at least, beyond which problem-solving is no path to understanding."
- "For *solipsists*, the boundary tightly encloses their own brains, or perhaps just their abstract minds or incorporeal souls. For *the Inquisition*, it enclosed the entire Earth. Some present-day *Creationists* believe in a similar boundary, not in space but in time, for they believe that the universe was created only six thousand years ago, complete with misleading evidence of earlier events. *Behaviorism* is the doctrine chat it is not meaningful to explain human behavior in terms of inner mental processes. To behaviorists, the only legitimate psychology is the study of people's observable responses to external stimuli. Thus they draw exactly the same boundary as solipsists, separating the human mind from external reality; but while solipsists deny chat it is meaningful to reason about anything outside that boundary, behaviorists deny that it is meaningful to reason about anything inside."
- "There is a large class of related theories here, but we can usefully regard them all as variants of solipsism. They differ in where they draw the boundary of reality (or the boundary of chat part of reality which is comprehensible through problem-solving), and they differ in whether, and how, they seek knowledge outside that boundary. But they all consider scientific rationality and other problem-solving to be inapplicable outside the boundary - a mere game. They might concede that it can be a satisfying and useful game, but it is nevertheless only a game from which no valid conclusion can be drawn about the reality outside."
##### Philosophical refutation of solipsism
- "There is a standard philosophical joke about a professor who gives a lecture in defense of solipsism. So persuasive is the lecture that as soon as it ends, several enthusiastic students hurry forward to shake the professor's hand. 'Wonderful. I agreed with every word,' says one student earnestly. 'So did I,' says another. 'I am very gratified to hear it,' says the professor. 'One so seldom has the opportunity to meet fellow solipsists.', Implicit in this joke there is a genuine argument against solipsism. One could put it like this. What, exactly, was the theory that the students in the story were agreeing with? Was it the professor's theory, that they themselves do not exist because only the professor exists?
- "if there are sources of ideas that behave as if they were independent of oneself, then they necessarily are independent of oneself. For if I define 'myself ' as the conscious entity that has the thoughts and feelings I am aware of having, then the 'dream-people' I seem to interact with are by definition something other than that narrowly defined self, and so I must concede that something other than myself exists."
- If you dreaming all of this into existence, consists of ideas and minds that object your apparent belief in solipsism and most of dream-people in your mind reject solipsism.
- solipsism begins by saying it's all a dream, but taken seriously the contents of the dream act unpredictably and in many cases autonomously and the physical world can even be studied, so basically nothing has changed except the addition of a useless assumption, the assumption that it's all a dream. page 82- for more detailed explanation
- "Thus we see that if we take solipsism seriously - if we assume that it is true and that all valid explanations must scrupulously conform to it - it self-destructs. How exactly does solipsism, taken seriously, differ from its common-sense rival, realism? The difference is based on no more than a renaming scheme."
- "solipsism, far from being a world-view stripped to its essentials, is actually just realism disguised and weighed down by **additional unnecessary assumptions - worthless baggage, introduced only to be explained away.**"
- "what can we say about the arguments that made solipsism and its relatives superficially plausible, namely that they could neither be proved false nor ruled out by experiment? What is the status of those arguments now? If we have neither proved solipsism false nor ruled it out by experiment, what have we done?"
##### knowledge as a hierarchy misconception
- there is an assumption built into those(previous section) questions, "**It is that theories can be classified in a hierarchy, 'mathematical' $\Longrightarrow$  'scientific' $\Longrightarrow$ 'philosophical', of decreasing intrinsic reliability. Many people take the existence of this hierarchy for granted, despite the fact that these judgements of comparative reliability depend entirely on philosophical arguments, arguments that classify themselves as quite unreliable!**"
- " the idea of this hierarchy is a cousin of the reductionist mistake I discussed in Chapter 1 (the theory that microscopic laws and phenomena are more fundamental than emergent ones) . The same assumption occurs in inductivism, which supposes that we can be absolutely certain of the conclusions of mathematical arguments because they are deductive, reasonably sure of scientific arguments because they are 'inductive', and forever undecided about philosophical arguments, which it sees as little more than matters of taste."
- "But none of that is true. Explanations are not justified by the means by which they were derived; they are justified by their superior ability, relative to rival explanations, to solve the problems they address. That is why the argument that a theory is indefensible can be s o compelling. A prediction, o r any assertion, that cannot be defended might still be true, but an explanation that cannot be defended is not an explanation."
- "The rejection of 'mere' explanations on the grounds that they are not justified by any ultimate explanation inevitably propels one into futile searches for an ultimate source of justification. There is no such source."
- "Nor is there that hierarchy of reliability from mathematical to scientific to philosophical arguments. Some philosophical arguments, including the argument against solipsism, are far more compelling than any scientific argument. Indeed, every scientific argument assumes the falsity not only of solipsism, but also of other philosophical theories including any number of variants of solipsism that might contradict specific parts of the scientific argument. I shall also show (in Chapter 10) that even purely mathematical arguments derive their reliability from the physical and philosophical theories that underpin them, and therefore that they cannot, after all, yield absolute certainty."
##### a criteria for reality
- but for realism, refutation of solipsism is not enough and we faced with decisions of as to whether entities that we are referring to in explanation are real or not, we need to develop reasons for accepting or rejecting the existence of entities that may appear in theories, we need a criteria for reality
- James Boswell relates in his *Life of Johnson* how he and Dr Johnson were discussing Bishop Berkeley's solipsistic theory of the non-existence of the material world. Boswell remarked that although no one believed the theory, no one could refute it either. Dr Johnson kicked a large rock and said as his foot rebounded, "R refute it thus". Dr Johnson's point was that Berkeley's denial of the rock's existence is incompatible with finding an explanation of the rebound that he himself felt. Solipsism cannot accommodate any explanation of why that experiment - or any experiment - should have one outcome rather than another. To explain the effect that the rock had on him, Dr Johnson was forced to take a position on the nature of rocks. Were they part of an autonomous external reality, or were they figments of his imagination? In the latter case he would have to conclude that 'his imagination' was itself a vast, complex, autonomous universe.
- "Dr Johnson's ideas is more than refutation of solipsism, it also illustrates the criterion for reality that is used in science, namely, *if something can kick back, it exists*. 'Kicking back' here does not necessarily mean that the alleged object is responding to being kicked - to being physically affected as Dr Johnson's rock was. It is enough that when we 'kick' something, the object affects us in ways that require independent explanation."
- "For example, Galileo had no means of affecting planets, but he could affect the light that came from them. His equivalent of kicking the rock was refracting that light through the lenses of his telescopes and eyes. That light responded by 'kicking' his retina back. The way it kicked back allowed him to conclude not only that the light was real, but that the heliocentric planetary motions required to explain the patterns in which the light arrived were also real."
- "By the way, Dr Johnson did not directly kick the rock either. A person is a mind, not a body. The Dr Johnson who performed the experiment was a mind, and that mind directly 'kicked' only some nerves, which transmitted signals to muscles, which propelled his foot towards the rock. Shortly afterwards, Dr Johnson perceived being 'kicked back' by the rock, but again only indirectly, after the impact had set up a pressure pattern in his shoe, and then in his skin, and had then led to electrical impulses in his nerves, and so forth."
- "Dr Johnson's mind, like Galileo's and everyone else's, 'kicked' nerves and 'was kicked back' by nerves, and inferred the existence and properties of reality from those interactions alone. What Dr Johnson was entitled to infer about reality depends on how he could best explain what had happened."
- "It is not how hard something kicks back that makes the theory of its existence compelling. What matters i s its role i n the explanations that such a theory provides. I have given examples from physics where very tiny 'kicks' lead us to momentous conclusions about reality because we have no other explanation."
- Complexity, we prefer simpler explanations to more complex ones and we prefer explanation that are capable for accounting for detail and complexity to explanations that can account only for simple aspects of phenomena. Dr Johnson's criterion tells us to regard as real those complex entities which, if we did not regard them as real, would complicate our explanations.
- Now we can rephrase Dr Johnson's criterion thus: *If, according to the simplest explanation, an entity is complex and autonomous, then that entity is real.*
- Computational complexity theory, a branch of computer science that is concerned with what resources (such as time, memory, energy) are required to perform given classes of computations, The complexity o f a piece o f information is defined in terms of the computational resources (such as the length of the program, the number of computational steps or the amount of memory) that a computer would need if it was to reproduce that piece of information. it has several different definitions but all are based on idea that a complex process is one that in effect presents us with the results of a substantial computation. The sense in which the motion of the planets 'presents us with the results of a substantial computation' is well illustrated by a planetarium. So we can re-express Dr Johnson's criterion again, in terms of hypothetical computations: *If a substantial amount of computation would be required to give us the illusion that a certain entity is real, then that entity is real.*
- the irreducible complexity of an entity which requires substantial resource to compute make it philosophically untenable to deny that the objects exist.
- "The physicist David Bohm constructed a theory with predictions identical to those of quantum theory, in which a sort of wave accompanies every photon, washes over the entire barrier, passes through the slits and interferes with the photon that we see. Bohm's theory is often presented as a single-universe variant of quantum theory. But according to Dr Johnson's criterion, that is a mistake. Working out what Bohm's invisible wave will do requires the same computations as working out what trillions of shadow photons will do. Some parts of the wave describe us, the observers, detecting and reacting to the photons; other parts of the wave describe other versions of us, reacting to photons in different positions. Bohm's modest nomenclature - referring to most of reality as a 'wave' - does not change the fact that in his theory reality consists of large sets of complex entities, each of which can perceive other entities in its own set, but can only indirectly perceive entities i n other sets. These sets of entities are, in other words, parallel universes."
##### Galileo's legacy 
- "I have described Galileo's new conception of our relationship with external reality as a great methodological discovery. It gave us a new, reliable form of reasoning involving observational evidence. That is indeed one aspect of his discovery: scientific reasoning is reliable, not in the sense that ' it certifies that any particular theory will survive unchanged, even until tomorrow, but in the sense that we are right to rely on it."
- "For we are right to seek solutions to problems rather than sources of ultimate justification. Observational evidence is indeed evidence, not in the sense that any theory can be deduced, induced or in any other way inferred from it, but in the sense that it can constitute a genuine reason for preferring one theory to another."
##### realism, evidence, self-similarity, optimism
- "But there is another side to Galileo's discovery which is much less often appreciated. The reliability of scientific reasoning is not just an attribute of us: of our knowledge and our relationship with reality. It is also a new fact about physical reality itself, a fact which Galileo expressed in the phrase 'the Book of Nature is written in mathematical symbols'. As I have said, it is impossible literally to 'read' any shred of a theory in nature: that is the inductivist mistake. But what is genuinely out there is evidence, or, more precisely, a reality that will respond with evidence if we interact appropriately with it. Given a shred of a theory, or rather, shreds of several rival theories, the evidence is available out there to enable us to distinguish between them. Anyone can search for it, find it and improve upon it if they take the trouble. They do not need authorization, or initiation, or holy texts. They need only be looking in the right way - with fertile problems and promising theories in mind. This open accessibility, not only of evidence but of the whole mechanism of knowledge acquisition, is a key attribute of Galileo's conception of reality. 
  Galileo may have thought this self-evident, but it is not. It is a substantive assertion about what physical reality is like. Logically, reality need not have had this science-friendly property, but it does and in abundance. Galileo's universe is saturated with evidence. Copernicus had assembled evidence for his heliocentric theory in Poland. Tycho Brahe had collected his evidence in Denmark, and Kepler had in Germany. And by pointing his telescope at the skies over Italy, Galileo gained greater access to the same evidence. Every part of the Earth's surface, on every clear night, for billions of years, has been deluged with evidence about the facts and laws of astronomy. For many other sciences evidence has similarly been on display, to be viewed more clearly in modern times by microscopes and other instruments. Where evidence is not already physically present, we can bring it into existence with devices such as lasers and pierced barriers - devices which it is open to anyone, anywhere and at any time, to build. And the evidence will be the same, regardless of who reveals it. The more fundamental a theory is, the more readily available is the evidence that bears upon it (to those who know how to look), not just on Earth but throughout the multiverse. 
  Thus physical reality is self-similar on several levels: among the stupendous complexities of the universe and multiverse, some patterns are nevertheless endlessly repeated. Earth and Jupiter are in many ways dramatically dissimilar planets, but they both move in ellipses, and they are made of the same set of a hundred or so chemical elements {albeit in different proportions) , and so are their parallel-universe counterparts. The evidence that so impressed Galileo and his contemporaries also exists on other planets and in distant galaxies. The evidence being considered at this moment by physicists and astronomers would also have been available a billion years ago, and will still be available a billion years hence. The very existence of general, explanatory theories implies that disparate objects and events are physically alike in some ways. The light reaching us from distant galaxies is, after all, only light, but it looks to us like galaxies. Thus reality contains not only evidence, but also the means {such as our minds, and our artifacts) of understanding it. There are mathematical symbols in physical reality. The fact that it is we who put them there does not make them any less physical. In those symbols - in our planetariums, books, films and computer memories, and in our brains - there are images of physical reality at large, images not just of the appearance of objects, but of the structure of reality. There are laws and explanations, reductive and emergent. There are descriptions and explanations of the Big Bang and of subnuclear particles and processes; there are mathematical abstractions; fiction; art; morality; shadow photons; parallel universes. To the extent that these symbols, images and theories are true - that is, they resemble in appropriate respects the concrete or abstract things they refer to - their existence gives reality a new sort of self-similarity, the self-similarity we call knowledge."
### Chapter 5 - Virtual Reality 
##### Theory of computation, universality
- theory of computation has been studied almost entirely in the abstract, as a topic in pure mathematics, this is to miss the point of it. Computers are physical objects and computations are physical processes.
- "what computers can or cannot compute is determined by the laws of physics alone, and not by pure mathematics."
- "One of the most important concepts of the theory of computation is universality. A universal computer is usually defined as an abstract machine that can mimic the computations of any other abstract machine in a certain well-defined class."
- "However, the significance of universality lies in the fact that universal computers, or at least good approximations to them, can actually be built, and can be used to compute not just each other's behavior but the behavior of interesting physical and abstract entities. The fact that this is possible is part of the self-similarity of physical reality that I mentioned in the previous chapter."
