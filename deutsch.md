## The Fabric Of Reality 
I read this book along with Brett Hall on his youtube channel, so I might add things that is from Brett.

#### 1 - The Theory of Everything

###### Understanding and explanation
- "understanding the fabric of reality doesn’t require to understand every single mere-known facts, but having the right **concept, explanations and theories**."
- "predicting and describing things is not the same thing as understanding them. things can be understood only by being explained."
- "a theory is about explanation and prediction is merely some of the consequences that we can deduce from the explanation."
- "scientific theories explain the object and phenomena that we of our experience in terms of an underlying reality which we do not experience directly, But the ability of a theory to explain what we experience is not its most valuable attribute. Its most valuable attribute is that it explains the fabric of reality itself."
- "one of the most valuable, significant and also useful attributes of human thought generally is its ability to reveal and explain the fabric of reality."
###### Instrumentalism
- "some philosophers and even some scientist disparage the role of explanation in science, to them the basic purpose of a scientific theory is not to explain anything. but to predict the outcomes of experiments."
- "Instrumentalism says that a theory is no more than an 'Instrument' for making predictions and that science can enable us to understand the underlying reality is a fallacy and explanation beyond prediction are empty words."
###### Positivism , Logical positivism
- "Positivism, an extreme form of instrumentalism holds that all statements than those describing or predicting observations are not only superfluous but meaningless."
- "On reason that instrumentalist and positivist ideas are plausible is that, although prediction is not the purpose of science, it is part of the characteristic method of science. the scientific method involves postulating a new theory to explain some class of phenomena and then performing a **crucial experimental test**. in an experiment if one theory predict one observable outcome and new theory another, one rejects the theory whose predictions turns out to be false, So the outcome of a crucial experimental test decides between two theories does depend on their prediction not their explanation, this is the source of misconception. majority of theories are rejected because they contain bad explanations, not because they fail experimental tests."
###### Explanation 
- "the real purpose of science is to **explain** the world."
- "it is hard to give a precise definition of 'explanation' or 'understanding'.  they are about 'why' rather than 'what'; about the inner workings of things; about how things really are, not just how they appear to be; about what must be so, rather than what merely happens to be so; about laws of nature rather than rules of thumb."
- Brett : "One reason we can’t give strict definition to explanations is we have to allow for new modes of explanations, to allow our definition of explanation to be elastic and allow new modes of explanations to be invented in the future". (Read the beginning of infinity)
- "Explanations are also about coherence, elegance and simplicity, as opposed to arbitrariness and complexity, though none of those things is easy to define either."
- "Prediction – even perfect, universal prediction – is simply no substitute for explanation."
- "Understanding is one of the higher functions of the human mind and brain, and a unique one. Many other physical systems, such as animals' brains, computers and other machines, can assimi­late facts and act upon them. But at present we know of nothing that is capable of understanding an explanation or of wanting one in the first place other than a human mind. Every discovery of a new explanation, and every act of grasping an existing expla­nation, depends on the uniquely human faculty of creative thought."

###### Theory of Everything
- "the issue of whether it is becoming harder or easier to understand everything that is understood depends o the overall balance between these two opposing effects of the growth of know­ledge: the increasing **breadth** of our theories, and their increasing **depth**. **Breadth makes it harder; depth makes it easier**. One thesis of this book is that, slowly but surely, depth is winning."
- "We are not heading away from a state in which one person could understand everything that is understood, but towards it."
- "It is not that we shall soon understand everything. That is a completely different issue. I do not believe that we are now, or ever shall be, close to understanding **everything there is**. What I am discussing is the possibility of understanding **everything that is understood**. this depend on structure of our knowledge and if the fabric of reality is itself highly unified"
- "understanding everything that is understood depends on structure of knowledge and structure of knowledge depends on what the fabric of reality as a whole is like. if fabric of reality is itself highly unified, eventually our theories will become so general, deep and integrated with one another that they will become a single theory of a unified fabric of reality. This theory will still not explain every aspect of reality: that is unattainable. But it will encompass all known explanations, and will apply to the whole fabric of reality in so far as it is understood. Whereas all previous theories related to particular subjects, this will be a theory of all subjects: **a Theory of Everything**. it will not be the last such theory only the first and we expect them to be superseded by deeper, more accurate theories."
- "in science even our best theories are bound to be imperfect and problematic. humans are fallible."
- "Deutsch's theory of everything is different from some particle physicists's theory of everything that they hope they will achieve some day, Their 'theory of everything' would be a unified theory of all the basic forces known to physics, namely gravity, electromagnetism and nuclear forces.(this narrow ToE is motivated by bad and mistaken view of the nature of science namely reductionism). this ToE only provide a tiny facet of Real ToE."

###### Reductionism, Holism
- "reductionism is a view that scientific explanations are inherently reductive. and reductive is one that works by analyzing things into lower-level components. and consists of analyzing a system into smaller and simpler systems."
- "Holism, the idea that the only legitimate explanations are in terms of higher-level systems; the opposite of reductionism."
- "A reductionist thinks that science is about analyzing things into components. An instrumentalist thinks that it is about predicting things."
- "reductionism assumes that all explanation is of later events in terms of earlier events; in other words, that the only way of explaining something is to state its causes. And this implies that the earlier the events in terms of which we explain something, the better the explanation, so that ultimately the best explanations of all are in terms of the initial state of the universe."
###### emergence, emergent phenomena
- "emergence: high-level simplicity 'emerges' from low-level complexity. High-level phenomena about which there are comprehensible facts that are not simply deducible from lower-level theories are called emergent phenomena. and they need to understood in their own terms and at that level not at the level of physics."
- "emergence: An emergent phenomenon is one (such as life, thought or computation) about which there are comprehensible facts or explanations that are not simply deducible from lower-level theories, but which may be explicable or predictable by higher­-level theories referring directly to that phenomenon."
- "Complexity prevents us from using fundamental physics to make high-level predictions, so instead we guess what those predictions would be if we could make them -- emergence gives us a chance of doing that successfully -- and suppos­edly that is what the higher-level sciences are about."
- An example for the importance of emergent explanations: 
  "For example, consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low­ level physical observation - the presence of a copper atom at a particular location - through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. 
  There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive 'theory of everything' would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor's studio, and so on. They could also state how those trajectories were influenced by forces exerted by surrounding atoms, such as those comprising the miners' and sculptor's bodies, and so predict the existence and shape of the statue. In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom's being there, you would still not be able to say, 'Ah yes, now I understand why it is there.' You would merely know that its arrival there in that way was inevitable (or likely, or whatever), given all the atoms' initial configurations and the laws of physics. I f you wanted to understand why, you would still have no option but to take a further step. You would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing this inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to dis­ cover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenom­ena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand fully why that copper atom is where it is."
###### Four main strands of Deutsch's theory of everything
- 1 - Quantum theory also Everettian Quantum theory 
- 2 - Epistemology(Theory of Knowledge): The study of the nature of knowledge and the processes that create it.
- 3 - Theory of Computation
- 4 - Theory of evolution
- "The fabric of reality does not consist only of reductionist ingredients like space, time and subatomic particles, but also of life, thought, computation and the other things to which those explanations refer."

#### 2 - Shadow

###### Prerequisites 
-  "the arguments I have presented in this chapter are compelling only to those who seek explanations."
