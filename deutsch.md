## The Fabric Of Reality 
I read this book along with Brett Hall on his youtube channel, so I might add things that is from Brett.

### Chapter 1 - The Theory of Everything

##### Understanding and explanation
- "understanding the fabric of reality doesn’t require to understand every single mere-known facts, but having the right **concept, explanations and theories**."
- "predicting and describing things is not the same thing as understanding them. things can be understood only by being explained."
- "a theory is about explanation and prediction is merely some of the consequences that we can deduce from the explanation."
- "scientific theories explain the object and phenomena that we of our experience in terms of an underlying reality which we do not experience directly, But the ability of a theory to explain what we experience is not its most valuable attribute. Its most valuable attribute is that it explains the fabric of reality itself."
- "one of the most valuable, significant and also useful attributes of human thought generally is its ability to reveal and explain the fabric of reality."
##### Instrumentalism
- "some philosophers and even some scientist disparage the role of explanation in science, to them the basic purpose of a scientific theory is not to explain anything. but to predict the outcomes of experiments."
- "Instrumentalism says that a theory is no more than an 'Instrument' for making predictions and that science can enable us to understand the underlying reality is a fallacy and explanation beyond prediction are empty words."
##### Positivism , Logical positivism
- "Positivism, an extreme form of instrumentalism holds that all statements than those describing or predicting observations are not only superfluous but meaningless."
- "On reason that instrumentalist and positivist ideas are plausible is that, although prediction is not the purpose of science, it is part of the characteristic method of science. the scientific method involves postulating a new theory to explain some class of phenomena and then performing a **crucial experimental test**. in an experiment if one theory predict one observable outcome and new theory another, one rejects the theory whose predictions turns out to be false, So the outcome of a crucial experimental test decides between two theories does depend on their prediction not their explanation, this is the source of misconception. majority of theories are rejected because they contain bad explanations, not because they fail experimental tests."
##### Explanation 
- "the real purpose of science is to **explain** the world."
- "it is hard to give a precise definition of 'explanation' or 'understanding'.  they are about 'why' rather than 'what'; about the inner workings of things; about how things really are, not just how they appear to be; about what must be so, rather than what merely happens to be so; about laws of nature rather than rules of thumb."
- Brett : "One reason we can’t give strict definition to explanations is we have to allow for new modes of explanations, to allow our definition of explanation to be elastic and allow new modes of explanations to be invented in the future". (Read the beginning of infinity)
- "Explanations are also about coherence, elegance and simplicity, as opposed to arbitrariness and complexity, though none of those things is easy to define either."
- "Prediction – even perfect, universal prediction – is simply no substitute for explanation."
- "Understanding is one of the higher functions of the human mind and brain, and a unique one. Many other physical systems, such as animals' brains, computers and other machines, can assimi­late facts and act upon them. But at present we know of nothing that is capable of understanding an explanation or of wanting one in the first place other than a human mind. Every discovery of a new explanation, and every act of grasping an existing expla­nation, depends on the uniquely human faculty of creative thought."

##### Theory of Everything
- "the issue of whether it is becoming harder or easier to understand everything that is understood depends o the overall balance between these two opposing effects of the growth of know­ledge: the increasing **breadth** of our theories, and their increasing **depth**. **Breadth makes it harder; depth makes it easier**. One thesis of this book is that, slowly but surely, depth is winning."
- "We are not heading away from a state in which one person could understand everything that is understood, but towards it."
- "It is not that we shall soon understand everything. That is a completely different issue. I do not believe that we are now, or ever shall be, close to understanding **everything there is**. What I am discussing is the possibility of understanding **everything that is understood**. this depend on structure of our knowledge and if the fabric of reality is itself highly unified"
- "understanding everything that is understood depends on structure of knowledge and structure of knowledge depends on what the fabric of reality as a whole is like. if fabric of reality is itself highly unified, eventually our theories will become so general, deep and integrated with one another that they will become a single theory of a unified fabric of reality. This theory will still not explain every aspect of reality: that is unattainable. But it will encompass all known explanations, and will apply to the whole fabric of reality in so far as it is understood. Whereas all previous theories related to particular subjects, this will be a theory of all subjects: **a Theory of Everything**. it will not be the last such theory only the first and we expect them to be superseded by deeper, more accurate theories."
- "in science even our best theories are bound to be imperfect and problematic. humans are fallible."
- "Deutsch's theory of everything is different from some particle physicists's theory of everything that they hope they will achieve some day, Their 'theory of everything' would be a unified theory of all the basic forces known to physics, namely gravity, electromagnetism and nuclear forces.(this narrow ToE is motivated by bad and mistaken view of the nature of science namely reductionism). this ToE only provide a tiny facet of Real ToE."

##### Reductionism, Holism
- "reductionism is a view that scientific explanations are inherently reductive. and reductive is one that works by analyzing things into lower-level components. and consists of analyzing a system into smaller and simpler systems."
- "Holism, the idea that the only legitimate explanations are in terms of higher-level systems; the opposite of reductionism."
- "A reductionist thinks that science is about analyzing things into components. An instrumentalist thinks that it is about predicting things."
- "reductionism assumes that all explanation is of later events in terms of earlier events; in other words, that the only way of explaining something is to state its causes. And this implies that the earlier the events in terms of which we explain something, the better the explanation, so that ultimately the best explanations of all are in terms of the initial state of the universe."
##### emergence, emergent phenomena
- "emergence: high-level simplicity 'emerges' from low-level complexity. High-level phenomena about which there are comprehensible facts that are not simply deducible from lower-level theories are called emergent phenomena. and they need to understood in their own terms and at that level not at the level of physics."
- "emergence: An emergent phenomenon is one (such as life, thought or computation) about which there are comprehensible facts or explanations that are not simply deducible from lower-level theories, but which may be explicable or predictable by higher­-level theories referring directly to that phenomenon."
- "Complexity prevents us from using fundamental physics to make high-level predictions, so instead we guess what those predictions would be if we could make them -- emergence gives us a chance of doing that successfully -- and suppos­edly that is what the higher-level sciences are about."
- An example for the importance of emergent explanations: 
  "For example, consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low­ level physical observation - the presence of a copper atom at a particular location - through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. 
  There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive 'theory of everything' would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor's studio, and so on. They could also state how those trajectories were influenced by forces exerted by surrounding atoms, such as those comprising the miners' and sculptor's bodies, and so predict the existence and shape of the statue. In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom's being there, you would still not be able to say, 'Ah yes, now I understand why it is there.' You would merely know that its arrival there in that way was inevitable (or likely, or whatever), given all the atoms' initial configurations and the laws of physics. I f you wanted to understand why, you would still have no option but to take a further step. You would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing this inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to dis­ cover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenom­ena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand fully why that copper atom is where it is."
##### Four main strands of Deutsch's theory of everything
- 1 - Quantum theory also Everettian Quantum theory 
- 2 - Epistemology(Theory of Knowledge): The study of the nature of knowledge and the processes that create it.
- 3 - Theory of Computation
- 4 - Theory of evolution
- "The fabric of reality does not consist only of reductionist ingredients like space, time and subatomic particles, but also of life, thought, computation and the other things to which those explanations refer."

### Chapter 2 - Shadow

##### Prerequisites 
-  "the arguments I have presented in this chapter are compelling only to those who seek explanations."
- "Those who are satisfied with mere prediction, and who have no strong desire to understand how the predicted outcomes of experi­ments come about, may if they wish simply deny the existence of anything other than what I have been calling 'tangible' entities(deny multiverse)."
- "understanding the multiverse is a precondition for understand­ing reality as best we can."
- read this chapter of book, I can’t articulate what David explained.
##### Quantum theory
**everything** in the universe like water, light, gold (matter in general)etc... are made of smallest possible unit called quantum(plural quanta) and are not continuous. in short everything is quantized and Quantum theory gets its name from this property. 
Quantum theory is about studying and understanding quanta, the smallest possible unit(such as particles) and multiverse.
##### Light
light for example comes in packets, the smallest possible unit of light called **photon**, particle of light. apparently beam of light looks continuous because every second it pours about $10^{14}$ (a hundred trillion) pho­tons into an eye that looks into it.

Look at this image:
![narrow beam](/assets/narrow%20beam.png)
*source: the fabric of reality*

Light instead of passing through the holes in straight lines it refuses to confined and spreads out after each holes and as it sprays it frays.
but light is made of photons and photons are particle, so this is unexpected.

And this is the pattern of light and shadow formed by light after passing through a small circular hole:
![](/assets/circular%20hole.png)
*source: the fabric of reality*

there is nothing happening here but the casting of a shadow. this what would look like when light passes the second screen from previous image..
If light travelled only in straight line, there would only be a tiny white dote(smaller than white spot in image)
##### Double-slit experiment
this experiment makes most physicists get crazy and confused.(and quantum theory in general:))
this is how it works: light passes through **double tiny slits** and a barrier cast a very strange shadow:
![](/assets/double%20slit%20experiment.jpg)

and this is more explanatory image of shadows:
![](/assets/double%20slit.png)
but why would a light passing through two straight parallel slits cast a shadow like this and not just a pair of bright band?

Now what if we have four straight parallel slits?:
![](/assets/double%20slit%20vs%20four%20slit.png)
as figure shows, 4 slits pattern cast more complicated pattern.

something must be coming through that second pair of slits to prevent the light from the first pair from reaching X, but what?
whatever that causes the **interference** is in the light beam.
##### Single-particle double slit experiment
What should we expect to happen when these experiments are performed with only one photon at a time?
![](/assets/single%20particle%20double%20slit.png)
"So, if the photons do not split into fragments, and are not being deflected by other photons, what does deflect them? When a single photon at a time is passing through the apparatus, what can be coming through the other slits to interfere with it?"
"We have found that when one photon passes through this apparatus,  
it passes through one of the slits, and then something interferes with it, deflecting it in a way that depends on what other slits are open;
the interfering entities have passed through some of the other slits;
the interfering entities behave exactly like photons . . .  
. . . except that they cannot be seen."

Bingo! that is right!
**turns out photons from other universes interfere with photons from our universe and make interference pattern**
photons of our universe are called *tangible* photons, and photons of other universes are called *shadow* photons.
Tangible photons are the ones we can see or detect with devices, whereas the shadow photons are intangible(invisible) and detectable only indirectly through their interference effect on the tangible photons.

Interference: is something affecting that light that would have struck X but which didn’t. 
In other words interference is photon that are visible colliding with photon that are invisible, these photon that cannot be seen push aside the photons that you can see, because if they weren’t there, then the photon would’ve just continued off through that double-slit and landed behind on of those two slits.

At least a trillion shadow photons accompanying each tangible one.
"Thus we have inferred the existence of a seething, prodigiously complicated, hidden world of shadow photons. They travel at the speed of light, bounce off mirrors, are refracted by lenses, and are stopped by opaque barriers or filters of the wrong colour. Yet they do not trigger even the most sensitive detectors. The only thing in the universe that a shadow photon can be observed to affect is the tangible photon that it accompanies. That is the phenomenon of interference. Shadow photons would go entirely unnoticed were it not for this phenomenon and the strange patterns of shadows by which we observe it."

And Interference is not only for photons, it occurs for every sort of particle, so there must be hosts of shadow neutrons accom­panying every tangible neutron, hosts of shadow electrons accompanying every electron, and so on. Each of these shadow particles is detectable only indirectly, through its interference with the motion of its tangible counterpart.
##### Multiverse 
Reality is much bigger than it seems and most of it is invisible.
Every shadow photon in this universe is tangible in parallel universes(its own universe) and there are nearly infinite universe out there. there exist many version of me and you in parallel universes that are doing something else or writing and reading this note that I am taking from David's book.
And the whole universe(all parallel universes) are obeying the same laws of physics.

**For more detail read the chapter 2: shadows**

### Chapter 3 - Problem-solving 

##### What justifies these inferences?
- "I do not know which is stranger - the behavior of shadows itself, or the fact that contemplating a few patterns of light and shadow can force us to revise so radically our conception of the structure of reality."
- "What justifies these inferences? Can we be sure that just because a star appeared millimetrically displaced on Eddington's photo­ graphic plate, space and time must be curved; or that because a photodetector at a certain position does not register a 'hit' in weak light, there must be parallel universes?"
- "There is no getting away from the fact that we human beings are small creatures with only a few inaccurate, incomplete channels through which we receive all information from outside ourselves. We interpret this infor­mation as evidence of a large and complex external universe (or multiverse). But when we are weighing up this evidence, we are literally contemplating nothing more than patterns of weak electric current trickling through our own brains."
- "What justifies the inferences we draw from these patterns? It is certainly not a matter of logical deduction. There is no way of *proving* from these or from any other observations that the external universe, or multiverse, exists at all, let alone that the electric currents received by our brains stand in any particular relationship to it."

##### Solipsism
- "Anything or everything that we perceive might be an illusion or a dream. Illusions and dreams are, after all, common. **Solipsism**, the theory that only one mind exists and that what appears to be external reality is only a dream taking place in that mind, cannot be logically disproved."
- "Since solipsism, and an infinity of related theories, are logically consistent with your perceiving any possible observational evidence, it follows that you can logically deduce nothing about reality from observational evidence. How, then, could I say that the observed behavior of shadows 'rules out' the theory that there is only one universe, or that eclipse observations make the Newtonian world-view 'rationally untenable'? How can that be so? If 'ruling out' does not mean 'disproving', what does it mean? Why should we feel compelled to change our world-view, or indeed any opinion at all, on account of something being 'ruled out' in that sense?"
- "This critique seems to cast doubt on the whole of science - on any reasoning about external reality that appeals to observational evi­dence. If scientific reasoning does not amount to sequences of logi­cal deductions from the evidence, what does it amount to? Why should we accept its conclusions? This is known as the **'problem of induction'.**"

##### Induction
- "The name derives from what was, for most of the history of science, the prevailing theory of *how science works.* The theory was that there exists, short of mathematical proof, a lesser but still worthy form of justification called induction."
- "In the inductivist theory of scientific knowledge, observations play two roles: first, in the discovery of scientific theories, and second, in their justification. A theory is supposed to be discovered by 'extrapolating' or 'generalizing' the results of observations. Then, if large numbers of observations conform to the theory, and none deviates from it, the theory is supposed to be justified - made more believable, probable or reliable."

![](/assets/inductivist%20scheme.png)
*inductivist scheme*

- "The inductivist analysis of my discussion of shadows would therefore go something like this: 'We make a series of observations of shadows, and see interference phenomena (stage 1). The results conform to what would be expected if there existed parallel uni­verses which affect one another in certain ways. But at first no one notices this. Eventually (stage 2) someone forms the generalization that interference will always be observed under the given circum­stances, and thereby induces the theory that parallel universes are responsible. With every further observation of interference (stage 3) we become a little more convinced of that theory. After a suf­ficiently long sequence of such observations, and provided that none of them ever contradicts the theory, we conclude (stage 4) that the theory is true. Although we can never be absolutely sure, we are for practical purposes convinced.'"
- "It is hard to know where to begin in criticizing the inductivist conception of science, it is so profoundly false in so many different ways. Perhaps the worst flaw, from my point of view, is the sheer non sequitur that a generalized prediction is tantamount to a new theory. Like all scientific theories of any depth, the theory that there are parallel universes simply does not have the form of a generalization from the observations. Did we observe first one uni­ verse, then a second and a third, and then induce that there are trillions of them? Was the generalization that planets will 'wander' round the sky in one pattern rather than another, equivalent to the theory that planets are worlds, in orbit round the Sun, and that the Earth is one of them?"
- " It is also not true that repeating our observations is the way in which we become convinced of scientific theories. As I have said, theories are explanations, not merely pre­dictions. If one does not accept a proposed explanation of a set of observations, making the observations over and over again is sel­dom the remedy. Still less can it help us to create a satisfactory explanation when we cannot think of one at all."
##### Bertrand Russell's chicken story, inductivism is false:
- "The chicken noticed that the farmer came every day to feed it. It predicted that the farmer would continue to bring food every day. Inductivists think that the chicken had 'extrapolated' its observations into a theory, and that each feeding time added justification to that theory. Then one day the farmer came and wrung the chicken's neck."
- David on chicken story: 
  "The disappointment experienced by Russell's chicken has also been experienced by trillions of other chickens. This inductively justifies the conclusion that induction cannot justify any conclusions!
  However, this line of criticism lets inductivism off far too lightly. It does illustrate the fact that repeated observations cannot justify theories, but in doing so it entirely misses (or rather, accepts) a more basic misconception: namely, that the inductive extrapolation of observations to form new theories is even possible. In fact, it is impossible to extrapolate observations unless one has already placed them within an explanatory framework. For example, in order to 'induce' its false prediction, Russell's chicken must first have had in mind a false explanation of the farmer's behavior. Perhaps it guessed that the farmer harbored benevolent feelings towards chickens. Had it guessed a different explanation - that the farmer was trying to fatten the chickens up for slaughter, for instance - it would have 'extrapolated' the behavior differently. Suppose that one day the farmer starts bringing the chickens more food than usual. How one extrapolates this new set of observations to predict the farmer's future behavior depends entirely on how one explains it. According to the benevolent-farmer theory, it is evidence that the farmer's benevolence towards chickens has increased, and that therefore the chickens have even less to worry about than before. But according to the fattening-up theory, the behavior is ominous - it is evidence that slaughter is imminent."
- "Admittedly, inductivism is based on the common-sense theory of the growth of knowledge - that we learn from experience - and historically **it was associated with the liberation of science from dogma and tyranny**. **But if we want to understand the true nature of knowledge, and its place in the fabric of reality, we must face up to the fact that inductivism is false, root and branch. No scientific reasoning, and indeed no successful reasoning of any kind, has ever fitted the inductivist description**."

##### What now? a better theory for scientific discovery and knowledge, Karl Popper, Problem-solving 
- With all these inductivism and other prediction-centered theories of knowledge that are based on a misconception, what then is the pattern of scientific reasoning and discovery? we need a better and explanation-centered theory of knowledge, a theory of how explanations come into begin and how they are justified.
- Karl Popper's theory of knowledge and scientific discovery, regards science(and knowledge) as a ***problem-solving*** process, Inductivism regards the catalogue of the past observations as a sort of skeletal theory, supposing that science is all about filling in the gaps in that theory by interpolation and extrapolation.
- Problem-solving process begin with an inadequate theory, it begins with our best existing theories. when some of those theories seem inadequate, we want new one, **that is what constitutes a problem.** contrary to the inductivist scheme scien­tific discovery need not begin with observational evidence. But it does always begin with a problem.
- A problem does not necessarily mean a practical emergency or source of anxiety, it can be a set of ideas that seems inadequate and try to improve them. existing theory may seem glib, labored or unnecessarily narrow or it may be that there have been some surprising observations which existing theories did not predict and cannot explain. "This last type of problem resembles stage 1 of the inductivist scheme, but only superficially. For an unexpected observation never initiates a scientific discovery unless the pre-existing theories already contain the seeds of the problem.", (observation is theory-laden)

![](/assets/problem-solving%20process.png)
*problem-solving process. applies to all problem-solving, whatever the subject matter*

- "One solves a problem by finding new or amended theories, con­taining explanations which do not have the deficiencies, but do retain the merits, of existing explanations (Figure 3.2). Thus, after a problem presents itself (stage 1), the 11ext stage always involves conjecture: proposing new theories, or modifying or reinterpreting old ones, in the hope of solving the problem (stage 2). The conjec­tures are then criticized which, if the criticism is rational, entails examining and comparing them to see which offers the best expla­nations, according to the criteria inherent in the problem (stage 3). When a conjectured theory fails to survive criticism - chat is, when it appears to offer worse explanations than other theories do - it is abandoned. If we find ourselves abandoning one of our originally held theories in favour of one of the newly proposed ones (stage 4), we tentatively deem our problem-solving enterprise to have made progress. I say 'tentatively', because subsequent problem­ solving will probably involve altering or replacing even these new, apparently satisfactory theories, and sometimes even resurrecting some of the apparently unsatisfactory ones. Thus the solution, however good, is not the end of the story: it is a starting-point for the next problem-solving process (stage 5)."
-  "A good explanation may make good predictions about the future, but the one thing that no explanation can even begin to predict is the content or quality of its own future rivals."

![](/assets/scientific%20discovery%20process.png)
*the course of scientific discovery*

- "Scientific problem-solving always includes a particular method of rational criticism, namely ***experimental testing***. Where two or more rival theories make conflicting predictions about the outcome of an experiment, the experiment is performed and the theory or theories that made false predictions are abandoned. The very construction of scientific conjectures is focused on finding explanations that have experimentally testable predictions. Ideally we are always seeking crucial experimental tests - experiments whose outcomes, whatever they are, will falsify one or more of the contending theories."
- "That is why there is a methodological rule in science which says that once an experimentally testable theory has passed the appropriate tests, any *less* testable rival theories about the same phenomena are summarily rejected, for their explanations are bound to be inferior. ***This rule is often cited as distinguishing science from other types of knowledge-creation.***"
- "But if we take the view that science is about explanations, we see that this rule is really a special case of something that applies naturally to all problem-solving: ***theories that are capable of giving more detailed explanations are automatically preferred***.
  They are preferred for two reasons. One is that a theory that 'sticks its neck out' by being more specific about more phenomena opens up itself and its rivals to more forms of criticism, and therefore has more chance of taking the problem-solving process forward. The second is simply that, if such a theory survives the criticism, it leaves less unexplained - which is the object of the exercise."
- there is also constant backtracking, in some situations explanation doesn’t fit to the problem and problem need to change, or criticism fails and need to change the proposed solution and so on...

## David's quotes

- "science is about explaining the seen in terms of unseen" 
  example by brett:"(explaining the seen) color of certain flames (in terms of the unseen) movements of electrons around the nucleus of an atom"
