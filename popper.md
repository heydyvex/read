## An Introduction to Philosophy of Karl Popper by Bryan Magee

- "Most of the great revolutions in science have turned on theories of breathtaking audacity not only in respect of creative imagination but in the depth of insight involved, and the independence of mind, the unsecured adventurousness of thought, required." (this is a good argument for why freedom and liberty is a must and first priority.)

- "At no stage are we able to prove that what we now 'know' is true, and it is always possible that it will turn out to be false." (this is fallibilism)

- "Popper's notion of 'the truth' is very like this: our concern in the pursuit of knowledge is to get closer and closer to the truth, and we may even know that we have made an advance, but we can never know if we have reached our goal. 'We cannot identify science with truth, for we think that both Newton's and Einstein's theories belong to science, but they cannot both be true, and they may well both be false.' 
  One of his favorite quotations is from the pre-Socratic philosopher Xenophanes, which he translates as follows:
  The gods did not reveal, from the beginning,
  All things to us, but in the course of time
  Through seeking we may learn and know things better.
  But as for certain truth, no man has known it,
  Nor shall he know it, neither of the gods
  Nor yet of all the things of which I speak.
  For even if by chance he were to utter
  The final truth, he would himself not know it:
  For all is but a woven web of guesses."

- "Language analysts believe that there are no genuine philosophical problems, or that the problems of philosophy, if any, are problems of linguistic usage, or of the meaning of words. **I, however, believe that there is at least one philosophical problem in which all thinking men are interested. It is the problem of cosmology: the problem of understanding the world - including ourselves, and our knowledge, as part of the world. All science is cosmology, I believe, and for me the interest of philosophy, no less than of science, lies solely in the contributions which it has made to it**."

- "The traditional view of scientific method had the following stages in the following order, each giving rise to the next :
  1 - observation and experiment; 2 - inductive generalization; 3 - hypothesis; 4 - attempted verification of hypothesis; 5 - proof or disproof; 6 - knowledge. 
  Popper replaced this with: 
  1 - problem (usually rebuff to existing theory or expectation); 2 - proposed solution, in other words a new theory; 3 - deduction of testable propositions from the new theory; 4 - tests, i.e. attempted refutations by, among other things (but only among other things) observation and experiment; 5 - preference established between competing theories."

- "Popper's theory of knowledge is coterminous with a theory of evolution. Problem-solving is the primal activity: and the primal problem is survival."

- "One reason why Popper rejects empiricist epistemology, and insists that all observation must be theory-soaked, is that our sensory organs themselves, representing as they do sophisticated attempts to adapt to our environment, incorporate theories."

- "Popper believes that it is language, in the sense of a structured form of contact, communication, description and argument through signs and symbols, that makes us human not only as a species but as individuals : that for each one of us the acquisition of a language in this sense makes full human consciousness, the consciousness of self, possible."

- Popper's formula of continuous development(problem solving and growth of knowledge):
  $$\large P_1 \longrightarrow TS \longrightarrow EE \longrightarrow P_2$$
  $P_1$ is the initial problem, $TS$ is the trial solution proposed, $EE$ the process of error elimination applied to the trial solution and $P_2$ the resulting situation, with new problems.
  First of all it focuses interest on problems, not only for oneself but in one's appreciation of the efforts of others. A task does not begin with the attempt to solve a problem (the trial solution is the second term in the formula, not the first). It begins with the problem itself, and with the reasons for its being a problem. One learns to work hard and long at the formulation of problems before one switches one's main attention to the search for possible solutions; and one's degree of success in the latter is often determined by one's degree of success in the former.

- If one studies the work of, say, a philosopher, the first question one asks oneself is : 'What problem is he trying to solve?' This may sound obvious, but in my experience most students of philosophy are not taught to ask, and do not think to ask themselves, this question. Rather they ask: 'What is he trying to say?' As a result they commonly have the experience of thinking they understand what he is saying without seeing the point of his saying it. For only by understanding his problem-situation could they do that.

- For it has been widely believed, and in our century more than any other, that rationality, logic, the scientific approach, call for a society which is centrally organized, and planned and ordered as a whole. Popper has shown that this, besides being authoritarian, rests on a mistaken and superseded conception of science. Rationality, logic and a scientific approach all point to a society which is 'open' and pluralistic, within which incompatible views are expressed and conflicting aims pursued; a society in which everyone is free to investigate problem-situations and to propose solutions; a society in which everyone is free to criticize the proposed solutions of others, most importantly those of the government, whether in prospect or application; and above all a society in which the government's policies are changed in the light of criticism.

- Popper's view on politics, I think popper says without government we will fall for another form of tyranny, and may abolish the institutions that we already have. and absolute freedom can end up to no freedom at all. but he admits that optimal society is the one that extends and maximize individual freedom from moral and practical point of view. he also says democracy is not about "who should rule",  but it is about "removing bad ruler and bad policy without violence". 
  he argue that government should intervene(no less, no much, in-between) in economy and other things,  I intend to disagree with Popper here and try to look for better explanations  about non-government intervention that cause less problem...

- instead of encouraging one to think about building Utopia it makes one seek out, and try to remove, the specific social evils under which human beings are suffering. In this way it is above all a practical approach, and yet one devoted to change. It starts from concern with human beings, and involves a permanent, active willingness to remould institutions.

- 'Minimize unhappiness' is not just a negative formulation of the Utilitarian maxim 'Maximize happiness'. There is a logical asymmetry here: we do not know how to make people happy, but we do know ways of lessening their unhappiness.

- Near the centre of Popper's explanation of the appeal of totalitarianism is a socio-psychological concept which he calls 'the strain of civilization' - a concept related, as he acknowledges, to that formulated by Freud in Civilization and Its Discontents. We often hear it asserted that most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility. Whether or not this applies to 'most people' there is, I am sure, a vital element of truth in it. Accepting responsibility for our lives involves continually facing difficult choices and decisions, and bearing the consequences of them when they are wrong, and this is burdensome, not to say alarming. And there is something in all of us, something infantile perhaps, which would like to escape it by having the load taken from our shoulders. However, our strongest instinct being the instinct for survival, our strongest need is probably the need for security; so we are prepared to shift responsibility only to someone or something in whom we have greater confidence than in ourselves. (This is why people want their rulers to be 'better' than they are, and why they embrace so many implausible beliefs that reinforce confidence that they are, and why they are so seriously disturbed by revelations that they are not.) We want the unavoidable and difficult decisions that govern our lives to be taken by someone stronger than ourselves who nevertheless has our interests at heart, as might a stern but benevolent father; or else to be given to us by a practical system of thought that is wiser than we and makes fewer or no mistakes. Above all we want release from fear. And in the end most fears - including the most basic such as fear of the dark, fear of strangers, fear of death, fear of the consequences of our actions and fear of the future - are forms of fear of the unknown. So we are all the time pressing for assurances that the unknown is known really, and that what it contains is something we are going to want anyway. We embrace religions which assure us that we shall not die, and political philosophies which assure us that society will become perfect in the future, perhaps quite soon.

- We purchase freedom at the cost of security, equality at the cost of our self-esteem, and critical self-awareness at the cost of our peace of mind. The price is steep : none of us pays it happily, and many do not want to pay it at all.

##### What is Problem-situation?

Karl Popper's concept of "problem-situation" is an important element in his philosophy of science and epistemology. Here's an explanation of what he meant by this term:
1. Context of inquiry: A problem-situation refers to the specific context or background against which scientific questions are asked and theories are proposed.
2. Existing knowledge: It encompasses the current state of scientific knowledge, including accepted theories, available evidence, and recognized problems or puzzles.
3. Historical perspective: The problem-situation includes the historical development of ideas and theories leading up to the current state of understanding.
4. Competing theories: It involves awareness of different, often competing, explanations or theories that attempt to address the same phenomena.
5. Identified problems: A problem-situation includes recognized gaps in knowledge, contradictions, or unexplained phenomena that scientists are trying to resolve.
6. Methodological context: It includes the available methods, technologies, and experimental techniques that can be applied to investigate the problem.
7. Conceptual framework: The problem-situation encompasses the conceptual tools and language used to frame and discuss scientific issues.
8. Dynamic nature: Popper saw problem-situations as evolving over time as new discoveries are made and new questions arise.
9. Guiding research: Scientists work within a problem-situation, which helps focus their inquiries and shapes the questions they ask.
10. Theory evaluation: Theories are judged not in isolation, but in relation to the specific problem-situation they address.
For Popper, understanding the problem-situation was crucial for comprehending scientific progress. He argued that scientific theories should be evaluated not just on their own merits, but in terms of how well they address the specific problems and challenges presented by the current problem-situation.
This concept emphasizes that scientific inquiry doesn't happen in a vacuum, but is always situated within a complex web of existing knowledge, recognized problems, and available methods. It highlights the contextual nature of scientific discovery and theory development.

this is generated by Claude, I think it is pretty accurate.
