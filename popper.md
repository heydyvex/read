# Notes on Popper's Ideas

An Introduction to Philosophy of Karl Popper by Bryan Magee

- "Most of the great revolutions in science have turned on theories of breathtaking audacity not only in respect of creative imagination but in the depth of insight involved, and the independence of mind, the unsecured adventurousness of thought, required."   
  *this is a good argument for why freedom and liberty is a must and first priority.*

- "At no stage are we able to prove that what we now 'know' is true, and it is always possible that it will turn out to be false."  
  this what fallibilism is

- "Popper's notion of 'the truth' is very like this: our concern in the pursuit of knowledge is to get closer and closer to the truth, and we may even know that we have made an advance, but we can never know if we have reached our goal. 'We cannot identify science with truth, for we think that both Newton's and Einstein's theories belong to science, but they cannot both be true, and they may well both be false.' 
  One of his favorite quotations is from the pre-Socratic philosopher Xenophanes, which he translates as follows:
  The gods did not reveal, from the beginning,
  All things to us, but in the course of time
  Through seeking we may learn and know things better.
  But as for certain truth, no man has known it,
  Nor shall he know it, neither of the gods
  Nor yet of all the things of which I speak.
  For even if by chance he were to utter
  The final truth, he would himself not know it:
  For all is but a woven web of guesses."
