# Notes on Popper's Ideas

##### An Introduction to Philosophy of Karl Popper by Bryan Magee

- "Most of the great revolutions in science have turned on theories of breathtaking audacity not only in respect of creative imagination but in the depth of insight involved, and the independence of mind, the unsecured adventurousness of thought, required."   
  *this is a good argument for why freedom and liberty is a must and first priority.*

- "At no stage are we able to prove that what we now 'know' is true, and it is always possible that it will turn out to be false."  
  this what fallibilism is

- "Popper's notion of 'the truth' is very like this: our concern in the pursuit of knowledge is to get closer and closer to the truth, and we may even know that we have made an advance, but we can never know if we have reached our goal. 'We cannot identify science with truth, for we think that both Newton's and Einstein's theories belong to science, but they cannot both be true, and they may well both be false.' 
  One of his favorite quotations is from the pre-Socratic philosopher Xenophanes, which he translates as follows:
  The gods did not reveal, from the beginning,
  All things to us, but in the course of time
  Through seeking we may learn and know things better.
  But as for certain truth, no man has known it,
  Nor shall he know it, neither of the gods
  Nor yet of all the things of which I speak.
  For even if by chance he were to utter
  The final truth, he would himself not know it:
  For all is but a woven web of guesses."

- "Language analysts believe that there are no genuine philosophical problems, or that the problems of philosophy, if any, are problems of linguistic usage, or of the meaning of words. **I, however, believe that there is at least one philosophical problem in which all thinking men are interested. It is the problem of cosmology: the problem of understanding the world - including ourselves, and our knowledge, as part of the world. All science is cosmology, I believe, and for me the interest of philosophy, no less than of science, lies solely in the contributions which it has made to it**."

- "The traditional view of scientific method had the following stages in the following order, each giving rise to the next :
  1 - observation and experiment; 2 - inductive generalization; 3 - hypothesis; 4 - attempted verification of hypothesis; 5 - proof or disproof; 6 - knowledge. 
  Popper replaced this with: 
  1 - problem (usually rebuff to existing theory or expectation); 2 - proposed solution, in other words a new theory; 3 - deduction of testable propositions from the new theory; 4 - tests, i.e. attempted refutations by, among other things (but only among other things) observation and experiment; 5 - preference established between competing theories."

- "Popper's theory of knowledge is coterminous with a theory of evolution. Problem-solving is the primal activity: and the primal problem is survival."

- "One reason why Popper rejects empiricist epistemology, and insists that all observation must be theory-soaked, is that our sensory organs themselves, representing as they do sophisticated attempts to adapt to our environment, incorporate theories."

- "Popper believes that it is language, in the sense of a structured form of contact, communication, description and argument through signs and symbols, that makes us human not only as a species but as individuals : that for each one of us the acquisition of a language in this sense makes full human consciousness, the consciousness of self, possible."
