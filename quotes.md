**Palmer Luckey on how he did come up with Virtual Reality idea:**  
“My ideological framework had been, ‘What’s the next step? How do I make my gaming PC better? How do I upgrade it?’”.  
“But then I just had this light bulb moment where I said, ‘Next step doesn’t matter. What’s the _last_ step?’ And that flipped my thinking upside down, because it allowed me to think in just a totally different way about the problem. And I immediately concluded, ‘Oh, it’s virtual reality. It’s the ability to literally feel like you’re inside of a game, as real as the real world. That’s the real purpose of all of this. The next step might be eight monitors instead of six, but the last step is virtual reality. That’s what I’m going to do.’”
