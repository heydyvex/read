### Brett Hall's quotes.
Usually from his youtube channel.

- Empiricism *only* gets something right that is better to learn from experience(an encounter with reality) better than authority(scripture or a man) and doing what they say.
- All life is problem-solving rather than search for final truth, which would be end of science and knowledge creation, we expect to continually solve problems, this is the way of to find contentment(happiness and satisfaction) in the world. one of the meanings of life. 
- the centrality of problems is not merely to science but to the entire project of knowledge creation and the search for good explanations.
- we need larger population not smaller, we have poverty of ideas not resources.
- to study humans(us) one need to study all the knowledge and explanations that we have created.
- the creative act of explaining something is what it feels like to be conscious, that experience of being a creative entity is what we call consciousness. for anyone outside of you observing you they canâ€™t observe your consciousness but they can observe your creative outputs which is the unique thing about you is your creative output and the thing that distinguishes people in general from all other animals. 
- what is your process in learning a new subject? 
  I only learn things I'm interested in. And then, I don't think there's a method. It's messy and fun, undisciplined for the most part and if I get bored easily I move on to something else. But I can't give good advice here because I've broadly only ever studied precisely what I wanted to. In cases where I have tried hard, I've tended to do poorly (eg: languages).
- there is no knowledge hierarchy, and knowledge is like web that foundational, claiming mathematics is certain and it is built upon a firm foundation is not true and this claim is itself a philosophical argument.
