#### Computational Universality, Explanatory Universality, or CU , EU
- Computational Universality is a law of physics or it is more of a principle called Church–Turing–Deutsch principle - in other words it's law about laws, a law that other laws must obey - and it claims any physical processes are computable and they can be simulated inside of a computer and we can write a program for them in principle even we haven’t done it yet.
- Explanatory Universality depends on CU and it claims that our mind as a computer in theory understand any of those programs, we can model those inside of our own minds and understand those things.
- denying these principles is an appeal to the supernatural, it say there are things beyond our capacity to understand.
- The human brain is a universal computer and the human mind is a universal explainer.

#### Brett Hall's quotes.
Usually from his youtube channel.

- Empiricism *only* gets something right that is better to learn from experience(an encounter with reality) better than authority(scripture or a man) and doing what they say.
- All life is problem-solving rather than search for final truth, which would be end of science and knowledge creation, we expect to continually solve problems, this is the way of to find contentment(happiness and satisfaction) in the world. one of the meanings of life. 
- the centrality of problems is not merely to science but to the entire project of knowledge creation and the search for good explanations.
- we need larger population not smaller, we have poverty of ideas not resources.
- to study humans(us) one need to study all the knowledge and explanations that we have created.
- the creative act of explaining something is what it feels like to be conscious, that experience of being a creative entity is what we call consciousness. for anyone outside of you observing you they can’t observe your consciousness but they can observe your creative outputs which is the unique thing about you is your creative output and the thing that distinguishes people in general from all other animals. 
- what is your process in learning a new subject? 
  I only learn things I'm interested in. And then, I don't think there's a method. It's messy and fun, undisciplined for the most part and if I get bored easily I move on to something else. But I can't give good advice here because I've broadly only ever studied precisely what I wanted to. In cases where I have tried hard, I've tended to do poorly (eg: languages).
- there is no knowledge hierarchy, and knowledge is like web not foundational, claiming mathematics is certain and it is built upon a firm foundation is false and this claim is itself a philosophical argument, this is also false.
- "you're a mind in the darkness of your skull and as David says you're in perfect complete darkness"
- "observation serves the purpose of deciding between scientific theories already guessed"
- "when conversation(or every situation in general) is too abstract and divorced from reality, ask and think that what is the problem and what problem are you trying to solve."
- "The more we know, the more there will be to know."
- "knowledge is not truth, it is useful information tends to get itself copied."
- "the whole point of fabric of reality is to understand everything that is understood"
- "error is natural state of things"
