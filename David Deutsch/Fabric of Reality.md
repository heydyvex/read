## The Fabric Of Reality 
I read this book along with Brett Hall's ToKCast podcast

### Chapter 1 - The Theory of Everything
"Since I was a child I wanted to understand everything that was understood"
##### Understanding and explanation
- "understanding the fabric of reality doesn’t require to understand every single mere-known facts, but having the right **concept, explanations and theories**."
- "predicting and describing things is not the same thing as understanding them. things can be understood only by being explained."
- "a theory is about explanation and prediction is merely some of the consequences that we can deduce from the explanation."
- "scientific theories explain the object and phenomena that we of our experience in terms of an underlying reality which we do not experience directly, But the ability of a theory to explain what we experience is not its most valuable attribute. Its most valuable attribute is that it explains the fabric of reality itself."
- "one of the most valuable, significant and also useful attributes of human thought generally is its ability to reveal and explain the fabric of reality."
##### Instrumentalism
- "some philosophers and even some scientist disparage the role of explanation in science, to them the basic purpose of a scientific theory is not to explain anything. but to predict the outcomes of experiments."
- "Instrumentalism says that a theory is no more than an 'Instrument' for making predictions and that science can enable us to understand the underlying reality is a fallacy and explanation beyond prediction are empty words."
##### Positivism , Logical positivism
- "Positivism, an extreme form of instrumentalism holds that all statements than those describing or predicting observations are not only superfluous but meaningless."
- "On reason that instrumentalist and positivist ideas are plausible is that, although prediction is not the purpose of science, it is part of the characteristic method of science. the scientific method involves postulating a new theory to explain some class of phenomena and then performing a **crucial experimental test**. in an experiment if one theory predict one observable outcome and new theory another, one rejects the theory whose predictions turns out to be false, So the outcome of a crucial experimental test decides between two theories does depend on their prediction not their explanation, this is the source of misconception. majority of theories are rejected because they contain bad explanations, not because they fail experimental tests."
##### Explanation 
- "the real purpose of science is to **explain** the world."
- "it is hard to give a precise definition of 'explanation' or 'understanding'.  they are about 'why' rather than 'what'; about the inner workings of things; about how things really are, not just how they appear to be; about what must be so, rather than what merely happens to be so; about laws of nature rather than rules of thumb."
- Brett : "One reason we can’t give strict definition to explanations is we have to allow for new modes of explanations, to allow our definition of explanation to be elastic and allow new modes of explanations to be invented in the future". (Read the beginning of infinity)
- "Explanations are also about coherence, elegance and simplicity, as opposed to arbitrariness and complexity, though none of those things is easy to define either."
- "Prediction – even perfect, universal prediction – is simply no substitute for explanation."
- "Understanding is one of the higher functions of the human mind and brain, and a unique one. Many other physical systems, such as animals' brains, computers and other machines, can assimi­late facts and act upon them. But at present we know of nothing that is capable of understanding an explanation or of wanting one in the first place other than a human mind. Every discovery of a new explanation, and every act of grasping an existing expla­nation, depends on the uniquely human faculty of creative thought."

##### Theory of Everything
- "the issue of whether it is becoming harder or easier to understand everything that is understood depends o the overall balance between these two opposing effects of the growth of know­ledge: the increasing **breadth** of our theories, and their increasing **depth**. **Breadth makes it harder; depth makes it easier**. One thesis of this book is that, slowly but surely, depth is winning."
- "We are not heading away from a state in which one person could understand everything that is understood, but towards it."
- "It is not that we shall soon understand everything. That is a completely different issue. I do not believe that we are now, or ever shall be, close to understanding **everything there is**. What I am discussing is the possibility of understanding **everything that is understood**. this depend on structure of our knowledge and if the fabric of reality is itself highly unified"
- "understanding everything that is understood depends on structure of knowledge and structure of knowledge depends on what the fabric of reality as a whole is like. if fabric of reality is itself highly unified, eventually our theories will become so general, deep and integrated with one another that they will become a single theory of a unified fabric of reality. This theory will still not explain every aspect of reality: that is unattainable. But it will encompass all known explanations, and will apply to the whole fabric of reality in so far as it is understood. Whereas all previous theories related to particular subjects, this will be a theory of all subjects: **a Theory of Everything**. it will not be the last such theory only the first and we expect them to be superseded by deeper, more accurate theories."
- "in science even our best theories are bound to be imperfect and problematic. humans are fallible."
- "Deutsch's theory of everything is different from some particle physicists's theory of everything that they hope they will achieve some day, Their 'theory of everything' would be a unified theory of all the basic forces known to physics, namely gravity, electromagnetism and nuclear forces.(this narrow ToE is motivated by bad and mistaken view of the nature of science namely reductionism). this ToE only provide a tiny facet of Real ToE."

##### Reductionism, Holism
- "reductionism is a view that scientific explanations are inherently reductive. and reductive is one that works by analyzing things into lower-level components. and consists of analyzing a system into smaller and simpler systems."
- "Holism, the idea that the only legitimate explanations are in terms of higher-level systems; the opposite of reductionism."
- "A reductionist thinks that science is about analyzing things into components. An instrumentalist thinks that it is about predicting things."
- "reductionism assumes that all explanation is of later events in terms of earlier events; in other words, that the only way of explaining something is to state its causes. And this implies that the earlier the events in terms of which we explain something, the better the explanation, so that ultimately the best explanations of all are in terms of the initial state of the universe."
##### emergence, emergent phenomena
- "emergence: high-level simplicity 'emerges' from low-level complexity. High-level phenomena about which there are comprehensible facts that are not simply deducible from lower-level theories are called emergent phenomena. and they need to understood in their own terms and at that level not at the level of physics."
- "emergence: An emergent phenomenon is one (such as life, thought or computation) about which there are comprehensible facts or explanations that are not simply deducible from lower-level theories, but which may be explicable or predictable by higher­-level theories referring directly to that phenomenon."
- "Complexity prevents us from using fundamental physics to make high-level predictions, so instead we guess what those predictions would be if we could make them -- emergence gives us a chance of doing that successfully -- and suppos­edly that is what the higher-level sciences are about."
- An example for the importance of emergent explanations: 
  "For example, consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low­ level physical observation - the presence of a copper atom at a particular location - through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. 
  There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive 'theory of everything' would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor's studio, and so on. They could also state how those trajectories were influenced by forces exerted by surrounding atoms, such as those comprising the miners' and sculptor's bodies, and so predict the existence and shape of the statue. In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom's being there, you would still not be able to say, 'Ah yes, now I understand why it is there.' You would merely know that its arrival there in that way was inevitable (or likely, or whatever), given all the atoms' initial configurations and the laws of physics. I f you wanted to understand why, you would still have no option but to take a further step. You would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing this inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to dis­ cover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenom­ena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand fully why that copper atom is where it is."
##### Four main strands of Deutsch's theory of everything
- 1 - Quantum theory also Everettian Quantum theory 
- 2 - Epistemology(Theory of Knowledge): The study of the nature of knowledge and the processes that create it.
- 3 - Theory of Computation
- 4 - Theory of evolution
- "The fabric of reality does not consist only of reductionist ingredients like space, time and subatomic particles, but also of life, thought, computation and the other things to which those explanations refer."

### Chapter 2 - Shadow

##### Prerequisites 
-  "the arguments I have presented in this chapter are compelling only to those who seek explanations."
- "Those who are satisfied with mere prediction, and who have no strong desire to understand how the predicted outcomes of experi­ments come about, may if they wish simply deny the existence of anything other than what I have been calling 'tangible' entities(deny multiverse)."
- "understanding the multiverse is a precondition for understand­ing reality as best we can."
- read this chapter of book, I can’t articulate what David explained.
##### Quantum theory
**everything** in the universe like water, light, gold (matter in general)etc... are made of smallest possible unit called quantum(plural quanta) and are not continuous. in short everything is quantized and Quantum theory gets its name from this property. 
Quantum theory is about studying and understanding quanta, the smallest possible unit(such as particles) and multiverse.
##### Light
light for example comes in packets, the smallest possible unit of light called **photon**, particle of light. apparently beam of light looks continuous because every second it pours about $10^{14}$ (a hundred trillion) pho­tons into an eye that looks into it.

Look at this image:
![narrow beam](/assets/narrow%20beam.png)
*source: the fabric of reality*

Light instead of passing through the holes in straight lines it refuses to confined and spreads out after each holes and as it sprays it frays.
but light is made of photons and photons are particle, so this is unexpected.

And this is the pattern of light and shadow formed by light after passing through a small circular hole:
![](/assets/circular%20hole.png)
*source: the fabric of reality*

there is nothing happening here but the casting of a shadow. this what would look like when light passes the second screen from previous image..
If light travelled only in straight line, there would only be a tiny white dote(smaller than white spot in image)
##### Double-slit experiment
this experiment makes most physicists get crazy and confused.(and quantum theory in general:))
this is how it works: light passes through **double tiny slits** and a barrier cast a very strange shadow:
![](/assets/double%20slit%20experiment.jpg)

and this is more explanatory image of shadows:
![](/assets/double%20slit.png)
but why would a light passing through two straight parallel slits cast a shadow like this and not just a pair of bright band?

Now what if we have four straight parallel slits?:
![](/assets/double%20slit%20vs%20four%20slit.png)
as figure shows, 4 slits pattern cast more complicated pattern.

something must be coming through that second pair of slits to prevent the light from the first pair from reaching X, but what?
whatever that causes the **interference** is in the light beam.
##### Single-particle double slit experiment
What should we expect to happen when these experiments are performed with only one photon at a time?
![](/assets/single%20particle%20double%20slit.png)
"So, if the photons do not split into fragments, and are not being deflected by other photons, what does deflect them? When a single photon at a time is passing through the apparatus, what can be coming through the other slits to interfere with it?"
"We have found that when one photon passes through this apparatus,  
it passes through one of the slits, and then something interferes with it, deflecting it in a way that depends on what other slits are open;
the interfering entities have passed through some of the other slits;
the interfering entities behave exactly like photons . . .  
. . . except that they cannot be seen."

Bingo! that is right!
**turns out photons from other universes interfere with photons from our universe and make interference pattern**
photons of our universe are called *tangible* photons, and photons of other universes are called *shadow* photons.
Tangible photons are the ones we can see or detect with devices, whereas the shadow photons are intangible(invisible) and detectable only indirectly through their interference effect on the tangible photons.

Interference: is something affecting that light that would have struck X but which didn’t. 
In other words interference is photon that are visible colliding with photon that are invisible, these photon that cannot be seen push aside the photons that you can see, because if they weren’t there, then the photon would’ve just continued off through that double-slit and landed behind on of those two slits.

At least a trillion shadow photons accompanying each tangible one.
"Thus we have inferred the existence of a seething, prodigiously complicated, hidden world of shadow photons. They travel at the speed of light, bounce off mirrors, are refracted by lenses, and are stopped by opaque barriers or filters of the wrong colour. Yet they do not trigger even the most sensitive detectors. The only thing in the universe that a shadow photon can be observed to affect is the tangible photon that it accompanies. That is the phenomenon of interference. Shadow photons would go entirely unnoticed were it not for this phenomenon and the strange patterns of shadows by which we observe it."

And Interference is not only for photons, it occurs for every sort of particle, so there must be hosts of shadow neutrons accom­panying every tangible neutron, hosts of shadow electrons accompanying every electron, and so on. Each of these shadow particles is detectable only indirectly, through its interference with the motion of its tangible counterpart.
##### Multiverse 
Reality is much bigger than it seems and most of it is invisible.
Every shadow photon in this universe is tangible in parallel universes(its own universe) and there are nearly infinite universe out there. there exist many version of me and you in parallel universes that are doing something else or writing and reading this note that I am taking from David's book.
And the whole universe(all parallel universes) are obeying the same laws of physics.

**For more detail read the chapter 2: shadows**

### Chapter 3 - Problem-solving 

##### What justifies these inferences?
*warning: justify is this context doesn’t mean justification, meaning demonstrating the truth, but in this context David by word justify means "as an indication of methodologically or morally right thing to do."*

- "I do not know which is stranger - the behavior of shadows itself, or the fact that contemplating a few patterns of light and shadow can force us to revise so radically our conception of the structure of reality."
- "What justifies these inferences? Can we be sure that just because a star appeared millimetrically displaced on Eddington's photo­ graphic plate, space and time must be curved; or that because a photodetector at a certain position does not register a 'hit' in weak light, there must be parallel universes?"
- "There is no getting away from the fact that we human beings are small creatures with only a few inaccurate, incomplete channels through which we receive all information from outside ourselves. We interpret this infor­mation as evidence of a large and complex external universe (or multiverse). But when we are weighing up this evidence, we are literally contemplating nothing more than patterns of weak electric current trickling through our own brains."
- "What justifies the inferences we draw from these patterns? It is certainly not a matter of logical deduction. There is no way of *proving* from these or from any other observations that the external universe, or multiverse, exists at all, let alone that the electric currents received by our brains stand in any particular relationship to it."

##### Solipsism
- "Anything or everything that we perceive might be an illusion or a dream. Illusions and dreams are, after all, common. **Solipsism**, the theory that only one mind exists and that what appears to be external reality is only a dream taking place in that mind, cannot be logically disproved."
- "Since solipsism, and an infinity of related theories, are logically consistent with your perceiving any possible observational evidence, it follows that you can logically deduce nothing about reality from observational evidence. How, then, could I say that the observed behavior of shadows 'rules out' the theory that there is only one universe, or that eclipse observations make the Newtonian world-view 'rationally untenable'? How can that be so? If 'ruling out' does not mean 'disproving', what does it mean? Why should we feel compelled to change our world-view, or indeed any opinion at all, on account of something being 'ruled out' in that sense?"
- "This critique seems to cast doubt on the whole of science - on any reasoning about external reality that appeals to observational evi­dence. If scientific reasoning does not amount to sequences of logi­cal deductions from the evidence, what does it amount to? Why should we accept its conclusions? This is known as the **'problem of induction'.**"

##### Induction
*note: mathematical induction is not the same as induction in philosophy of science, and there is nothing wrong with it.*

- it was for most of the history of science, the prevailing theory of *how science works.* The theory was that there exists, short of mathematical proof, a lesser but still worthy form of justification called induction.
- "In the inductivist theory of scientific knowledge, observations play two roles: first, in the discovery of scientific theories, and second, in their justification. A theory is supposed to be discovered by 'extrapolating' or 'generalizing' the results of observations. Then, if large numbers of observations conform to the theory, and none deviates from it, the theory is supposed to be justified - made more believable, probable or reliable."

![](/assets/inductivist%20scheme.png)
*inductivist scheme*

- "The inductivist analysis of my discussion of shadows would therefore go something like this: 'We make a series of observations of shadows, and see interference phenomena (stage 1). The results conform to what would be expected if there existed parallel uni­verses which affect one another in certain ways. But at first no one notices this. Eventually (stage 2) someone forms the generalization that interference will always be observed under the given circum­stances, and thereby induces the theory that parallel universes are responsible. With every further observation of interference (stage 3) we become a little more convinced of that theory. After a suf­ficiently long sequence of such observations, and provided that none of them ever contradicts the theory, we conclude (stage 4) that the theory is true. Although we can never be absolutely sure, we are for practical purposes convinced.'"
- "It is hard to know where to begin in criticizing the inductivist conception of science, it is so profoundly false in so many different ways. Perhaps the worst flaw, from my point of view, is the sheer non sequitur that a generalized prediction is tantamount to a new theory. Like all scientific theories of any depth, the theory that there are parallel universes simply does not have the form of a generalization from the observations. Did we observe first one uni­ verse, then a second and a third, and then induce that there are trillions of them? Was the generalization that planets will 'wander' round the sky in one pattern rather than another, equivalent to the theory that planets are worlds, in orbit round the Sun, and that the Earth is one of them?"
- " It is also not true that repeating our observations is the way in which we become convinced of scientific theories. As I have said, theories are explanations, not merely pre­dictions. If one does not accept a proposed explanation of a set of observations, making the observations over and over again is sel­dom the remedy. Still less can it help us to create a satisfactory explanation when we cannot think of one at all."
##### Bertrand Russell's chicken story, inductivism is false:
- "The chicken noticed that the farmer came every day to feed it. It predicted that the farmer would continue to bring food every day. Inductivists think that the chicken had 'extrapolated' its observations into a theory, and that each feeding time added justification to that theory. Then one day the farmer came and wrung the chicken's neck."
- David on chicken story: 
  "The disappointment experienced by Russell's chicken has also been experienced by trillions of other chickens. This inductively justifies the conclusion that induction cannot justify any conclusions!
  However, this line of criticism lets inductivism off far too lightly. It does illustrate the fact that repeated observations cannot justify theories, but in doing so it entirely misses (or rather, accepts) a more basic misconception: namely, that the inductive extrapolation of observations to form new theories is even possible. In fact, it is impossible to extrapolate observations unless one has already placed them within an explanatory framework. For example, in order to 'induce' its false prediction, Russell's chicken must first have had in mind a false explanation of the farmer's behavior. Perhaps it guessed that the farmer harbored benevolent feelings towards chickens. Had it guessed a different explanation - that the farmer was trying to fatten the chickens up for slaughter, for instance - it would have 'extrapolated' the behavior differently. Suppose that one day the farmer starts bringing the chickens more food than usual. How one extrapolates this new set of observations to predict the farmer's future behavior depends entirely on how one explains it. According to the benevolent-farmer theory, it is evidence that the farmer's benevolence towards chickens has increased, and that therefore the chickens have even less to worry about than before. But according to the fattening-up theory, the behavior is ominous - it is evidence that slaughter is imminent."
- "Admittedly, inductivism is based on the common-sense theory of the growth of knowledge - that we learn from experience - and historically **it was associated with the liberation of science from dogma and tyranny**. **But if we want to understand the true nature of knowledge, and its place in the fabric of reality, we must face up to the fact that inductivism is false, root and branch. No scientific reasoning, and indeed no successful reasoning of any kind, has ever fitted the inductivist description**."

##### What now? a better theory for scientific discovery and knowledge, Karl Popper, Problem-solving 
- With all these inductivism and other prediction-centered theories of knowledge that are based on a misconception, what then is the pattern of scientific reasoning and discovery? we need a better and explanation-centered theory of knowledge, a theory of how explanations come into begin and how they are justified.
- Karl Popper's theory of knowledge and scientific discovery, regards science(and knowledge) as a ***problem-solving*** process, Inductivism regards the catalogue of the past observations as a sort of skeletal theory, supposing that science is all about filling in the gaps in that theory by interpolation and extrapolation.
- **Problem-solving process begin with an inadequate theory, it begins with our best existing theories. when some of those theories seem inadequate, we want new one, that is what constitutes a problem.** contrary to the inductivist scheme scien­tific discovery need not begin with observational evidence. But it does always begin with a problem.
- A problem does not necessarily mean a practical emergency or source of anxiety, it can be a set of ideas that seems inadequate and try to improve them. existing theory may seem glib, labored or unnecessarily narrow or it may be that there have been some surprising observations which existing theories did not predict and cannot explain. "This last type of problem resembles stage 1 of the inductivist scheme, but only superficially. For an unexpected observation never initiates a scientific discovery unless the pre-existing theories already contain the seeds of the problem.", (observation is theory-laden)

![](/assets/problem-solving%20process.png)
*universal scheme of problem-solving process. applies to all problem-solving, whatever the subject matter*

- "One solves a problem by finding new or amended theories, con­taining explanations which do not have the deficiencies, but do retain the merits, of existing explanations (Figure 3.2). Thus, after a problem presents itself (stage 1), the 11ext stage always involves conjecture: proposing new theories, or modifying or reinterpreting old ones, in the hope of solving the problem (stage 2). The conjec­tures are then criticized which, if the criticism is rational, entails examining and comparing them to see which offers the best expla­nations, according to the criteria inherent in the problem (stage 3). When a conjectured theory fails to survive criticism - chat is, when it appears to offer worse explanations than other theories do - it is abandoned. If we find ourselves abandoning one of our originally held theories in favour of one of the newly proposed ones (stage 4), we tentatively deem our problem-solving enterprise to have made progress. I say 'tentatively', because subsequent problem­ solving will probably involve altering or replacing even these new, apparently satisfactory theories, and sometimes even resurrecting some of the apparently unsatisfactory ones. Thus the solution, however good, is not the end of the story: it is a starting-point for the next problem-solving process (stage 5)."
-  "**A good explanation may make good predictions about the future, but the one thing that no explanation can even begin to predict is the content or quality of its own future rivals**."

![](/assets/scientific%20discovery%20process.png)
*the course of scientific discovery,  scientific discovery scheme*

- "Scientific problem-solving always includes a particular method of rational criticism, namely ***experimental testing***. Where two or more rival theories make conflicting predictions about the outcome of an experiment, the experiment is performed and the theory or theories that made false predictions are abandoned. The very construction of scientific conjectures is focused on finding explanations that have experimentally testable predictions. Ideally we are always seeking crucial experimental tests - experiments whose outcomes, whatever they are, will falsify one or more of the contending theories."
- "That is why there is a methodological rule in science which says that once an experimentally testable theory has passed the appropriate tests, any *less* testable rival theories about the same phenomena are summarily rejected, for their explanations are bound to be inferior. ***This rule is often cited as distinguishing science from other types of knowledge-creation.***"
- "But if we take the view that science is about explanations, we see that this rule is really a special case of something that applies naturally to all problem-solving: ***theories that are capable of giving more detailed explanations are automatically preferred***.
  They are preferred for two reasons. One is that a theory that 'sticks its neck out' by being more specific about more phenomena opens up itself and its rivals to more forms of criticism, and therefore has more chance of taking the problem-solving process forward. The second is simply that, if such a theory survives the criticism, it leaves less unexplained - which is the object of the exercise."
- experimental test does not confirm and therefore justify a theory as to be the truth, it just corroborate the theory and doesn’t refute it, the main point of experimental test is to be able to refute the theory not to confirm and justify it.
- there is also constant backtracking, in some situations explanation doesn’t fit to the problem and problem need to change, or criticism fails and need to change the proposed solution and so on...
- and just the reminder that observation, perception and evidence all are theory-laden and all being interpreted by your mind. **before we even make an observation, we decide carefully where and when we should look and what we should look for**. our theoretical backgrounds and existing knowledge influence what we observe, how we perceive it, and how we interpret evidence.
- the whole problem-solving process take much amount of creativity and scientific discovery beside creativity, take so much time

##### Evolutionary epistemology 
- Popper's theory of growth of knowledge(problem-solving process) follow a process analogous to biological evolution, and this is why popper called his theory an evolutionary epistemology.
- all theories are being subjected to *variation* and *selection*, according to criteria which are themselves subject to variation and selection, and whole process resembles biological evolution.
- "A problem is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche. Variants of theories, like genetic mutations, are continually being created, and less successful variants become extinct when more successful variants take over. 'Success' is the ability to survive repeatedly under the selective pressures - criticism - brought to bear in that niche, and the criteria for that criticism depend partly on the physical characteristics of the niche and partly on the attri­butes of other genes and species (i.e. other ideas) that are already present there. The new world-view that may be implicit in a theory that solves a problem, and the distinctive features of a new species that takes over a niche, are *emergent* properties of the problem or niche. In other words, obtaining solutions is inherently complex. There is no simple way of discovering the true nature of planets, given (say) a critique of the celestial-sphere theory and some additional observations, just as there is no simple way of designing the DNA of a koala bear, given the properties of eucalyptus trees. Evolution, or trial and error - especially the focused, purposeful form of trial and error called scientific discovery - are the only ways."
- although there are important differences, one difference is that in biology vari­ations (mutations) are random, blind and purposeless, while in human problem-solving the creation of new conjectures is itself a complex, knowledge-laden process driven by the intentions of the people concerned.  Perhaps an even more important difference is that there is no biological equivalent of argument. All conjectures have t o b e tested experimentally, which i s one reason why biologi­cal evolution is slower and less efficient by an astronomically large factor.
- Both in science and in biological evolution, evolutionary success depends on the creation and survival of *objective knowledge*, which in biology is called *adaptation*. That is, **the ability of a theory or gene to survive in a niche is not a haphazard function of its structure but depends on whether enough true and useful information about the niche is implicitly or explicitly encoded there**.
- Evolution and Creativity(focused, purposeful form of trial and error that humans are capable of) are the only ways of solving problems hence creating knowledge.

##### Inductivism vs Science
- Inductivism is observation- and prediction-based, whereas in reality science is problem- and explanation-based.
- Inductivism supposes that theories are somehow extracted or distilled from observations, or are justified by them, whereas in fact theories begin as unjustified conjectures in someone's mind, which typically precede the observa­tions that rule out rival theories.
-  Inductivism seeks to justify predic­tions as likely to hold in the future. Problem-solving justifies an explanation as being better than other explanations available in the present.
- Inductivism is a dangerous and recurring source of many sorts of error, because it is superficially so plausible. But it is not true.
- When we succeed in solving a problem, scientific or otherwise, we end up with a set of theories which, though they arc not problem-free, we find preferable to the theories we started with. what new attributes the new theories will have therefore depends on what we saw as the deficiencies in our original theories, that is, on what the problem was.
- The problem in genuine science is always to understand some aspect of the fabric of reality, by finding expla­nations that are as broad and deep, and as true and specific, as possible.
- When we think that we have solved a problem, we naturally adopt our new set of theories in preference to the old set. That is why science, regarded as explanation-seeking and problem-solving, raises no 'problem of induction'. There is no mystery about why we should feel compelled tentatively to accept an explanation when it is the best explanation we can think of.

### Chapter 4 - Criteria for Reality
"problems and explanations are located within the human mind, which owes its reasoning power to a fallible brain, and its supply of information to fallible senses, **What, then, entitles a human mind to draw conclusions about objective, external reality from its own purely subjective experience and reason?**"

"**realism**, the common sense view that an external physical universe really does exist and does affect our senses, including senses enhanced by instruments such as telescopes."
##### Galileo Galilei
- Galileo, great physicist and arguably the first physicist in the modern sense, apart from many discovery he made in physics itself but he also did in the methodology of science.
- "He revived the ancient idea of expressing general theories about nature in mathematical form, and improved upon it by developing the method of systematic experimental testing, which characterizes science as we know it. He aptly called such tests *cimenti*, or 'ordeals'. He was one of the first to use telescopes to study celestial objects, and he collected and analyzed evidence for the heliocentric theory, the theory that the Earth moves in orbit around the Sun and spins about its own axis."
- he is known for his advocacy of heliocentric theory and for the  bitter conflict with the Church into which that advocacy brought him. in 1633 the Inquisition tried him for heresy, and forced him under the threat of torture to kneel and read aloud a long, abject recantation saying that he 'abjured, cursed and detested' the theory and was convicted and sentenced to house arrest under which eh remained for the rest of his life.
- but effect of trial had far-reaching consequences, the real dispute wasn’t about layout of solar system, it was about Galileo's brilliant advocacy of a new and dangerous way of thinking about reality. not about the existence of reality(both Church and Galileo believed in realism, common sense view that an external physical universe really exist and affect our senses),
  "Where Galileo differed was in his conception of the relationship between physical reality on the one hand, and human ideas, observations and reason on the other. He believed that the universe could be understood in terms of universal, mathematically formulated laws, and that reliable knowledge of these laws was accessible to human beings if they applied his method of mathematical formulation and systematic experimental testing. As he put it, 'the Book of Nature is written in mathematical symbols'. This was in conscious comparison with that other Book on which it was more conventional to rely."
- "**Galileo understood that if his method was indeed reliable, then wherever it was applicable its conclusions had to be preferable to those obtained by any other method. Therefore he insisted that scientific reasoning took precedence not only over intuition and common sense, but also over religious doctrine and revelation. It was specifically that idea, and not the heliocentric theory as such, that the authorities considered dangerous. (And they were right, for if any idea can be said to have initiated the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, and to have provided the secular foundation of modern civilization, it is that one.)**"
- By the way, it was forbidden to 'hold or defend' the heliocentric theory as an  an explanation of the appearance of the night sky, but using, writing about it, holding it as a mathematical supposition or defending it as a method of making predictions were all permitted.
##### Galileo and the Inquisition
- the fact is in Galileo’s time it was not yet indisputable that the heliocentric theory gave better predictions that the geocentric theory. the available observation were not very accurate. Ad hoc modifications had been proposed to improve the accuracy of the geocentric theory, and it was hard to quantify the predictive powers of the two rival theories.
- Galileo believed that the planets move in circles, while in fact their orbits are very nearly ellipses, so the data did not fit the particular heliocentric theory that Galileo was defending either.
- "Church took no position in this controversy. The Inquisition did not care where the planets *appeared* to be; what they cared about was reality. They cared where the planets really were, and they wanted to understand the planets through explanations, just as Galileo did. Instrumentalists and positivists would say that since the Church was perfectly willing to accept Galileo's observational predictions, further argument between them was pointless, and that his muttering 'eppur si muove' was strictly meaningless. But Galileo knew better, and so did the Inquisition. When they denied the reliability of scientific knowledge, it was precisely the explanatory part of that knowledge that they had in mind."
- "So how can we defend Galileo against the Inquisition? What should Galileo's defense have been in the face of this charge of claiming too much when he claimed that scientific theories contain reliable knowledge of reality ? The Popperian defense of science as a process of problem-solving and explanation-seeking is not sufficient in itself. For the Church too was primarily interested in explanations and not predictions, and it was quite willing to let Galileo solve problems using any theory he chose. It was just that they did not accept that Galileo's solutions (which they would call mere ' mathematical hypotheses') had any bearing on external reality."
- "**Problem-solving, after all , is a process that takes place entirely within human minds.** Galileo may have seen the world as a book in which the laws of nature are written in mathematical symbols. But that is strictly a metaphor; there are no explanations in orbit out there with the planets. **The fact is that all our problems and solutions are located within ourselves, having been created by ourselves. When we solve problems in science we arrive through argument at theories whose explanations seem best to us.**"
- "the Inquisition and modern skeptics might legitimately ask what scientific problem-solving has to do with reality. We may find our 'best explanations' psychologically satisfying. We may find them helpful in -making predictions. We certainly find them essential in every area of technological creativity. All this does justify our continuing to seek them and to use them i n those ways. But why should we be obliged to take them as fact?"
- "if making the right predictions were our only constraint, we could invent theories which say that anything we please is going on in space. For example, **observations alone can never rule out the theory that the Earth is enclosed in a giant planetarium showing us a simulation of a heliocentric solar system; and that outside the planetarium there is anything you like, or nothing at all.**"
##### Solipsism and Boundary for Reality
- "the Inquisition were realists. Yet their theory has this in common with solipsism: both of them draw an arbitrary boundary beyond which, they claim, human reason has no access or at least, beyond which problem-solving is no path to understanding."
- "For *solipsists*, the boundary tightly encloses their own brains, or perhaps just their abstract minds or incorporeal souls. For *the Inquisition*, it enclosed the entire Earth. Some present-day *Creationists* believe in a similar boundary, not in space but in time, for they believe that the universe was created only six thousand years ago, complete with misleading evidence of earlier events. *Behaviorism* is the doctrine chat it is not meaningful to explain human behavior in terms of inner mental processes. To behaviorists, the only legitimate psychology is the study of people's observable responses to external stimuli. Thus they draw exactly the same boundary as solipsists, separating the human mind from external reality; but while solipsists deny chat it is meaningful to reason about anything outside that boundary, behaviorists deny that it is meaningful to reason about anything inside."
- "There is a large class of related theories here, but we can usefully regard them all as variants of solipsism. They differ in where they draw the boundary of reality (or the boundary of chat part of reality which is comprehensible through problem-solving), and they differ in whether, and how, they seek knowledge outside that boundary. But they all consider scientific rationality and other problem-solving to be inapplicable outside the boundary - a mere game. They might concede that it can be a satisfying and useful game, but it is nevertheless only a game from which no valid conclusion can be drawn about the reality outside."
##### Philosophical refutation of solipsism
- "There is a standard philosophical joke about a professor who gives a lecture in defense of solipsism. So persuasive is the lecture that as soon as it ends, several enthusiastic students hurry forward to shake the professor's hand. 'Wonderful. I agreed with every word,' says one student earnestly. 'So did I,' says another. 'I am very gratified to hear it,' says the professor. 'One so seldom has the opportunity to meet fellow solipsists.', Implicit in this joke there is a genuine argument against solipsism. One could put it like this. What, exactly, was the theory that the students in the story were agreeing with? Was it the professor's theory, that they themselves do not exist because only the professor exists?
- "if there are sources of ideas that behave as if they were independent of oneself, then they necessarily are independent of oneself. For if I define 'myself ' as the conscious entity that has the thoughts and feelings I am aware of having, then the 'dream-people' I seem to interact with are by definition something other than that narrowly defined self, and so I must concede that something other than myself exists."
- If you dreaming all of this into existence, consists of ideas and minds that object your apparent belief in solipsism and most of dream-people in your mind reject solipsism.
- solipsism begins by saying it's all a dream, but taken seriously the contents of the dream act unpredictably and in many cases autonomously and the physical world can even be studied, so basically nothing has changed except the addition of a useless assumption, the assumption that it's all a dream. page 82- for more detailed explanation
- "Thus we see that if we take solipsism seriously - if we assume that it is true and that all valid explanations must scrupulously conform to it - it self-destructs. How exactly does solipsism, taken seriously, differ from its common-sense rival, realism? The difference is based on no more than a renaming scheme."
- "solipsism, far from being a world-view stripped to its essentials, is actually just realism disguised and weighed down by **additional unnecessary assumptions - worthless baggage, introduced only to be explained away.**"
- "what can we say about the arguments that made solipsism and its relatives superficially plausible, namely that they could neither be proved false nor ruled out by experiment? What is the status of those arguments now? If we have neither proved solipsism false nor ruled it out by experiment, what have we done?"
##### knowledge as a hierarchy misconception
- there is an assumption built into those(previous section) questions, "**It is that theories can be classified in a hierarchy, 'mathematical' $\Longrightarrow$  'scientific' $\Longrightarrow$ 'philosophical', of decreasing intrinsic reliability. Many people take the existence of this hierarchy for granted, despite the fact that these judgements of comparative reliability depend entirely on philosophical arguments, arguments that classify themselves as quite unreliable!**"
- " the idea of this hierarchy is a cousin of the reductionist mistake I discussed in Chapter 1 (the theory that microscopic laws and phenomena are more fundamental than emergent ones) . The same assumption occurs in inductivism, which supposes that we can be absolutely certain of the conclusions of mathematical arguments because they are deductive, reasonably sure of scientific arguments because they are 'inductive', and forever undecided about philosophical arguments, which it sees as little more than matters of taste."
- "But none of that is true. Explanations are not justified by the means by which they were derived; they are justified by their superior ability, relative to rival explanations, to solve the problems they address. That is why the argument that a theory is indefensible can be s o compelling. A prediction, o r any assertion, that cannot be defended might still be true, but an explanation that cannot be defended is not an explanation."
- "The rejection of 'mere' explanations on the grounds that they are not justified by any ultimate explanation inevitably propels one into futile searches for an ultimate source of justification. There is no such source."
- "Nor is there that hierarchy of reliability from mathematical to scientific to philosophical arguments. Some philosophical arguments, including the argument against solipsism, are far more compelling than any scientific argument. Indeed, every scientific argument assumes the falsity not only of solipsism, but also of other philosophical theories including any number of variants of solipsism that might contradict specific parts of the scientific argument. I shall also show (in Chapter 10) that even purely mathematical arguments derive their reliability from the physical and philosophical theories that underpin them, and therefore that they cannot, after all, yield absolute certainty."
##### a criteria for reality
- but for realism, refutation of solipsism is not enough and we faced with decisions of as to whether entities that we are referring to in explanation are real or not, we need to develop reasons for accepting or rejecting the existence of entities that may appear in theories, we need a criteria for reality
- James Boswell relates in his *Life of Johnson* how he and Dr Johnson were discussing Bishop Berkeley's solipsistic theory of the non-existence of the material world. Boswell remarked that although no one believed the theory, no one could refute it either. Dr Johnson kicked a large rock and said as his foot rebounded, "R refute it thus". Dr Johnson's point was that Berkeley's denial of the rock's existence is incompatible with finding an explanation of the rebound that he himself felt. Solipsism cannot accommodate any explanation of why that experiment - or any experiment - should have one outcome rather than another. To explain the effect that the rock had on him, Dr Johnson was forced to take a position on the nature of rocks. Were they part of an autonomous external reality, or were they figments of his imagination? In the latter case he would have to conclude that 'his imagination' was itself a vast, complex, autonomous universe.
- "Dr Johnson's ideas is more than refutation of solipsism, it also illustrates the criterion for reality that is used in science, namely, *if something can kick back, it exists*. 'Kicking back' here does not necessarily mean that the alleged object is responding to being kicked - to being physically affected as Dr Johnson's rock was. It is enough that when we 'kick' something, the object affects us in ways that require independent explanation."
- "For example, Galileo had no means of affecting planets, but he could affect the light that came from them. His equivalent of kicking the rock was refracting that light through the lenses of his telescopes and eyes. That light responded by 'kicking' his retina back. The way it kicked back allowed him to conclude not only that the light was real, but that the heliocentric planetary motions required to explain the patterns in which the light arrived were also real."
- "By the way, Dr Johnson did not directly kick the rock either. A person is a mind, not a body. The Dr Johnson who performed the experiment was a mind, and that mind directly 'kicked' only some nerves, which transmitted signals to muscles, which propelled his foot towards the rock. Shortly afterwards, Dr Johnson perceived being 'kicked back' by the rock, but again only indirectly, after the impact had set up a pressure pattern in his shoe, and then in his skin, and had then led to electrical impulses in his nerves, and so forth."
- "Dr Johnson's mind, like Galileo's and everyone else's, 'kicked' nerves and 'was kicked back' by nerves, and inferred the existence and properties of reality from those interactions alone. What Dr Johnson was entitled to infer about reality depends on how he could best explain what had happened."
- "It is not how hard something kicks back that makes the theory of its existence compelling. What matters i s its role i n the explanations that such a theory provides. I have given examples from physics where very tiny 'kicks' lead us to momentous conclusions about reality because we have no other explanation."
- Complexity, we prefer simpler explanations to more complex ones and we prefer explanation that are capable for accounting for detail and complexity to explanations that can account only for simple aspects of phenomena. Dr Johnson's criterion tells us to regard as real those complex entities which, if we did not regard them as real, would complicate our explanations.
- Now we can rephrase Dr Johnson's criterion thus: *If, according to the simplest explanation, an entity is complex and autonomous, then that entity is real.*
- Computational complexity theory, a branch of computer science that is concerned with what resources (such as time, memory, energy) are required to perform given classes of computations, The complexity o f a piece o f information is defined in terms of the computational resources (such as the length of the program, the number of computational steps or the amount of memory) that a computer would need if it was to reproduce that piece of information. it has several different definitions but all are based on idea that a complex process is one that in effect presents us with the results of a substantial computation. The sense in which the motion of the planets 'presents us with the results of a substantial computation' is well illustrated by a planetarium. So we can re-express Dr Johnson's criterion again, in terms of hypothetical computations: *If a substantial amount of computation would be required to give us the illusion that a certain entity is real, then that entity is real.*
- the irreducible complexity of an entity which requires substantial resource to compute make it philosophically untenable to deny that the objects exist.
- "The physicist David Bohm constructed a theory with predictions identical to those of quantum theory, in which a sort of wave accompanies every photon, washes over the entire barrier, passes through the slits and interferes with the photon that we see. Bohm's theory is often presented as a single-universe variant of quantum theory. But according to Dr Johnson's criterion, that is a mistake. Working out what Bohm's invisible wave will do requires the same computations as working out what trillions of shadow photons will do. Some parts of the wave describe us, the observers, detecting and reacting to the photons; other parts of the wave describe other versions of us, reacting to photons in different positions. Bohm's modest nomenclature - referring to most of reality as a 'wave' - does not change the fact that in his theory reality consists of large sets of complex entities, each of which can perceive other entities in its own set, but can only indirectly perceive entities i n other sets. These sets of entities are, in other words, parallel universes."
##### Galileo's legacy 
- "I have described Galileo's new conception of our relationship with external reality as a great methodological discovery. It gave us a new, reliable form of reasoning involving observational evidence. That is indeed one aspect of his discovery: scientific reasoning is reliable, not in the sense that ' it certifies that any particular theory will survive unchanged, even until tomorrow, but in the sense that we are right to rely on it."
- "For we are right to seek solutions to problems rather than sources of ultimate justification. Observational evidence is indeed evidence, not in the sense that any theory can be deduced, induced or in any other way inferred from it, but in the sense that it can constitute a genuine reason for preferring one theory to another."
##### realism, evidence, self-similarity, optimism
- "But there is another side to Galileo's discovery which is much less often appreciated. The reliability of scientific reasoning is not just an attribute of us: of our knowledge and our relationship with reality. It is also a new fact about physical reality itself, a fact which Galileo expressed in the phrase 'the Book of Nature is written in mathematical symbols'. As I have said, it is impossible literally to 'read' any shred of a theory in nature: that is the inductivist mistake. But what is genuinely out there is evidence, or, more precisely, a reality that will respond with evidence if we interact appropriately with it. Given a shred of a theory, or rather, shreds of several rival theories, the evidence is available out there to enable us to distinguish between them. Anyone can search for it, find it and improve upon it if they take the trouble. They do not need authorization, or initiation, or holy texts. They need only be looking in the right way - with fertile problems and promising theories in mind. This open accessibility, not only of evidence but of the whole mechanism of knowledge acquisition, is a key attribute of Galileo's conception of reality. 
  Galileo may have thought this self-evident, but it is not. It is a substantive assertion about what physical reality is like. Logically, reality need not have had this science-friendly property, but it does and in abundance. Galileo's universe is saturated with evidence. Copernicus had assembled evidence for his heliocentric theory in Poland. Tycho Brahe had collected his evidence in Denmark, and Kepler had in Germany. And by pointing his telescope at the skies over Italy, Galileo gained greater access to the same evidence. Every part of the Earth's surface, on every clear night, for billions of years, has been deluged with evidence about the facts and laws of astronomy. For many other sciences evidence has similarly been on display, to be viewed more clearly in modern times by microscopes and other instruments. Where evidence is not already physically present, we can bring it into existence with devices such as lasers and pierced barriers - devices which it is open to anyone, anywhere and at any time, to build. And the evidence will be the same, regardless of who reveals it. The more fundamental a theory is, the more readily available is the evidence that bears upon it (to those who know how to look), not just on Earth but throughout the multiverse. 
  Thus physical reality is self-similar on several levels: among the stupendous complexities of the universe and multiverse, some patterns are nevertheless endlessly repeated. Earth and Jupiter are in many ways dramatically dissimilar planets, but they both move in ellipses, and they are made of the same set of a hundred or so chemical elements {albeit in different proportions) , and so are their parallel-universe counterparts. The evidence that so impressed Galileo and his contemporaries also exists on other planets and in distant galaxies. The evidence being considered at this moment by physicists and astronomers would also have been available a billion years ago, and will still be available a billion years hence. The very existence of general, explanatory theories implies that disparate objects and events are physically alike in some ways. The light reaching us from distant galaxies is, after all, only light, but it looks to us like galaxies. Thus reality contains not only evidence, but also the means {such as our minds, and our artifacts) of understanding it. There are mathematical symbols in physical reality. The fact that it is we who put them there does not make them any less physical. In those symbols - in our planetariums, books, films and computer memories, and in our brains - there are images of physical reality at large, images not just of the appearance of objects, but of the structure of reality. There are laws and explanations, reductive and emergent. There are descriptions and explanations of the Big Bang and of subnuclear particles and processes; there are mathematical abstractions; fiction; art; morality; shadow photons; parallel universes. To the extent that these symbols, images and theories are true - that is, they resemble in appropriate respects the concrete or abstract things they refer to - their existence gives reality a new sort of self-similarity, the self-similarity we call knowledge."
### Chapter 5 - Virtual Reality 
##### Theory of computation, universality
- theory of computation has been studied almost entirely in the abstract, as a topic in pure mathematics, this is to miss the point of it. Computers are physical objects and computations are physical processes.
- "what computers can or cannot compute is determined by the laws of physics alone, and not by pure mathematics."
- "One of the most important concepts of the theory of computation is universality. A universal computer is usually defined as an abstract machine that can mimic the computations of any other abstract machine in a certain well-defined class."
- "However, the significance of universality lies in the fact that universal computers, or at least good approximations to them, can actually be built, and can be used to compute not just each other's behavior but the behavior of interesting physical and abstract entities. The fact that this is possible is part of the self-similarity of physical reality that I mentioned in the previous chapter."
##### What is Virtual Reality (VR)
- "The best-known physical manifestation of universality is an area of technology that has been mooted for decades but is only now beginning to take off, namely *virtual reality*."
- the term refer to any situation which a person is artificially give the experience of being in a specified environment, it is a simulation like flight or driving simulator that is used to help for pilots practicing it without flying, simulators can violate the laws of physics or be have totally different laws like flying without fuel or flying through mountain, faster than light.
- we experience our environment through our sense, and virtual reality(simulator) generator are able to manipulate our senses and overriding their normal functioning so we can experience the specified environment and not our actual one.
- human have been overriding the normal functioning of the senses, by representational art and long-distance communication, even prehistoric cane paintings gave the viewer something of the experience of seeing animals that were not actually there.
- image generator in this context is used for any device that can generate sensory input for user like specified picture, sound, odor so on..., any image generator is a rudimentary sort of virtual reality generator, but the term virtual reality is usually reserved for cases where there is both a wide converge of the user's sensory range and a substantial element of interaction ('kicking back') between the user and simulated entities.

##### VR and deceitfulness of the senses, misleading phenomena
- "If Bishop Berkeley or the Inquisition had known of virtual reality, they would probably have seized upon it as the perfect illustration of the deceitfulness of the senses, backing up their arguments against scientific reasoning."
- "What would happen if the pilot of a flight simulator tried to use Dr Johnson's test for reality? although the simulated aircraft and its surroundings do not really exist, they do 'kick back' at the pilot just as they would if they did exist. the pilot can open the throttle and hear the engines roar in response, and feel their thrust through the seat, and see them through the window, vibrating and blasting out hot gas, in spite of the fact that there are no engines there at all." but there are no such thing, just a computer and many sensory devices taking input or giving output.
- "Does this invalidate Dr Johnson's refutation of solipsism? No His conversation with Boswell could just as well have taken place inside a flight simulator. 'I refute it thus', he might have said, opening the throttle and feeling the simulated engine kick back. There is no engine there. What kicks back is ultimately a computer, running a program that calculates what an engine would do if it were 'kicked'." 
- "but those calculations, which are external to Dr Johnson's mind, respond to the throttle control in the same complex and autonomous way as the engine would, therefore they pass the test for reality, and rightly so, for in fact these calculations are physical processes within the computer, and the computer is an ordinary physical object - no less so than engine - and perfectly real. the fact that it is real *engine* is irrelevant to the argument against solipsism, not everything that is real has to be identify", in Dr Johnson's original demonstration if an object is complex and autonomous, Dr Johnson is right to conclude that it is real.
- from physics point of view, virtual-reality generator is just a physical object, obeying same laws of physics same as other do. but it can *pretend* otherwise, it can pretend to be completely different object with false laws of physics and pretend it in complex and autonomous way. If we had only such objects to learn physics from, would we learn the wrong laws? return to this question next chapter.
- "Bishop Berkeley would seem to have a point, that virtual reality is a token of the coarseness of human faculties - that it feasibility should warn us of inherent limitations on the capacity of human beings to understand the physical world. virtual-reality rendering might seem to fall into the same philosophical category as illusions, false trails and coincidence, for these phenomena which seem to show us something real but actually mislead us, and we have seen that scientific world-view can accommodate the existence of highly misleading phenomena. It is par excellence the world-view that can accommodate both human fallibility and external sources of error. but misleading phenomena are unwelcome, except for their curiosity value or when we learn from them why we are misled they are things we try to avoid and would rather do without. but virtual reality is not in that category. the existence of virtual reality does not indicate that the human capacity to understand the world is inherently limited, but, on the contrary, that it is inherently unlimited. It is no anomaly brought about by the accidental properties of human sense organs, but is a fundamental property of the multiverse at large. And the fact that the multiverse has this property, far from being a minor embarrassment for realism and science, is essential for both - it is the very property that makes science possible. It is not something that 'we would rather do without'; it is something that we literally could not do without."
##### The Limitations of VR

![](limitations%20of%20VR%20generator.png)
*A classification of experiences, with examples of each. VR is concerned with the generation of logically possible, external experiences(top-left region of the table).*

- external experience An experience of something outside one's own mind. 
- internal experience An experience of something within one's own mind.
- for more detail about limitations read page 103 - 
- ultimately the limits of VR to generate are laws of physics
##### Accuracy in VR = Theory and experiment in science
- accuracy of VR: accuracy is the closeness, as far as is perceptible, of the rendered environment to the intended one. But it must be close for every possible way in which the user might behave, and that is why, no matter how observant one is when experiencing a rendered environment, one cannot certify that it is accurate (or probably accurate) . But experience can sometimes show that a rendering is inaccurate (or probably inaccurate).
- accuracy in virtual reality mirrors the relationship between theory and experiment in science. There too, it is possible to confirm experimentally that a general theory is false, but never that it is true. And there too, a short-sighted view of science is that it is all about predicting our sense-impressions. The correct view is that, while sense-impressions always play a role, what science is about is understanding the whole of reality, of which only an infinitesimal proportion is ever experienced. 
- if the environment is physically possible, rendering it is essentially equivalent to finding rules for predicting the outcome of every experiment that could be performed in that environment. Because of the way in which scientific knowledge is created, ever more accurate predictive rules can be discovered only through ever better explanatory theories. So accurately rendering a physically possible environment depends on understanding its physics.
##### Reality exist but it is VR for us rendered by our mind, all form of thinking is program
- "discovering the physics of an environment depends on creating a virtual-reality rendering o f it. ... in a broad enough sense, taking into account the processes that must take place inside the scientist's mind, science and the virtual-reality rendering of physically possible environments are two terms denoting the same activity."
- "there are two distinct types of virtual-reality rendering: a minority that depict physically possible environment, and a majority that depict physically impossible environment. ... the connection between the physical world and the worlds that are renderable in virtual reality is far closer than it looks."
- "We might choose to render an environment as predicted by some 'laws of physics' that are different from the true laws of physics. We may do this as an exercise, or for fun, or as an approximation because the true rendering is too difficult or expensive. If the laws we are using are as close as we can make them to real ones, given the constraints under which we are operating, we may call these renderings 'applied mathematics' or 'computing'. If the rendered objects are very different from physically possible ones, we may call the rendering 'pure mathematics'. If a physically impossible environment is rendered for fun, we call it a 'video game' or 'computer art'."
- "It is not customary to think of mathematics as being a form of virtual reality. We usually think of mathematics as being about abstract entities, such as numbers and sets, which do not affect the senses; and it might therefore seem that there can be no question of artificially rendering their effect on us. However, although mathematical entities do not affect the senses, the experience of doing mathematics is an external experience, no less than the experience of doing physics is. We make marks on pieces of paper and look at them, or we imagine looking at such marks - indeed, we cannot do mathematics without imagining abstract mathematical entities. But this means imagining an environment whose 'physics' embodies the complex and autonomous properties of those entities. For example, when we imagine the abstract concept of a line segment which has no thickness, we may imagine a line that is visible but imperceptibly wide. That much may, just about, be arranged in physical reality. But mathematically the line must continue to have no thickness when we view it under arbitrarily powerful magnification. That is not a property of any physical line, but it can easily be achieved in the virtual reality of our imagination."
- "Imagination is a straightforward form of virtual reality. What may not be so obvious is that our 'direct' experience of the world through our senses is virtual reality too. For our external experience is never direct; nor do we even experience the signals in our nerves directly - we would not know what to make of the streams of electrical crackles that they carry. What we experience directly is a virtual-reality rendering, conveniently generated for us by our unconscious minds from sensory data plus complex inborn and acquired theories (i.e. programs) about how to interpret them."
- "We realists take the view that reality is out there: objective, physical and independent of what we believe about it. But we never experience that reality directly. Every last scrap of our external experience is of virtual reality. And every last scrap of our knowledge - including our knowledge of the non-physical worlds of logic, mathematics and philosophy, and of imagination, fiction, art and fantasy - is encoded in the form of programs for the rendering of those worlds on our brain's own virtual-reality generator."
- "So it is not just science - reasoning about the physical world - that involves virtual reality. All reasoning, all thinking and all external experience are forms of virtual reality. These things are physical processes which so far have been observed in only one place in the universe, namely the vicinity of the planet Earth. We shall see in Chapter 8 that all living processes involve virtual reality too, but human beings in particular have a special relationship with it. Biologically speaking, the virtual-reality rendering of their environment is the characteristic means by which human beings survive. In other words, it is the reason why human beings exist. The ecological niche that human beings occupy depends on virtual reality as directly and as absolutely as the ecological niche that koala bears occupy depends on eucalyptus leaves."
### Chapter 6  - Universality and the Limits of Computation 

- is there a way to build a machine that can compute any process in the universe or a VR to render any environment that human mind is capable of experiencing?
##### notes on computers and VR
- "a computer with an effectively unlimited memory capacity can be envisaged in principle. but a computer with an unlimited speed of computation cannot. a computer of given design will always have a fixed maximum speed, which only design changes can increase."
- If speed of VR computer cannot keep up with brain, in principle VR can take control of processing speed of the brain, if human brain were like an electronic computer, this would be a matter of changing the rate at which its emits synchronizing pulses, after all the brain is a finite physical object and all its functions are physical processes which in principle can be slowed down or stopped, the ultimate VR generator would have to be capable of doing that.
- "for our present purposes technological obstacles are irrelevant. We are not investigating what sorts of virtual-reality generator can be built, or even, necessarily, what sorts of virtual-reality generator will ever be built, by human engineers. We are investigating what the laws of physics do and do not allow in the way of virtual reality. The reason why this is important has nothing to do with the prospects for making better virtual-reality generators. It is that the relationship between virtual reality and 'ordinary' reality is part of the deep, unexpected structure of the world, which this book is about."
##### proof of VR computer and its repertoire limitations
- "The basic idea of the proof - known as a diagonal argument - predates the idea of virtual reality, it was first used by the 19th century mathematician Georg Cantor ti prove that there are infinite quantities greater than the infinity of natural numbers. The same form of proof is at the heart of the modern theory of computation developed by Alan Turing and others in the 1930s. It was also used by Kurt Gödel to prove his celebrated 'incompleteness theorem', of which more in Chapter 10."
- Each environment in our machine's repertoire is generated by some program for its computer. Imagine the set of all valid programs for this computer. From a physical point of view, each such program specifies a particular set of values for physical variables, on the disks or other media, that represent the computer's program.
- "We know from quantum theory that all such variables are quantized, and therefore that, no matter how the computer works, the set of possible programs is discrete. Each program can therefore be expressed as a finite sequence of symbols in a discrete code or computer language. Each program can therefore be expressed as a finite sequence of symbols in a discrete code or computer language. There are infinitely many such programs, but each one can contain only a finite number of symbols. That is because symbols are physical objects, made of matter in recognizable configurations, and one could not manufacture an infinite number of them."
- "As I shall explain in Chapter 10, these intuitively obvious physical requirements - that the programs must be quantized, and that each of them must consist of a finite number of symbols and can be executed in a sequence of steps - are more substantive than they seem. They are the only consequences of the laws of physics that are needed as input for the proof, but they are enough to impose drastic restrictions on the repertoire of any physically possible machine. Other physical laws may impose even more restrictions, but they would not affect the conclusions of this chapter."
- let’s imagine this infinite set of possible programs arranged in an infinitely long list, like program 1, program 2 and so on. because each program generates an environment, this list can also be regarded as a list of all the environments in the machine's repertoire; like environment 1, environment 2 and so on.
- "let me define a class of logically possible environment which I shall call *Cantgotu environments*(can't go to), partly in honor of Cantor, Gödel, Turing, and partly for other reason, They are defined as follows. For the first subjective minute, a Cantgotu environment behaves differently from Environment 1 (generated by Program 1 of our generator) . It does not matter how it does behave, so long as it is, to the user, recognizably different from Environment 1 . During the second minute it behaves differently from Environment 2. (though it is now allowed to resemble Environment 1 again) . During the third minute, it behaves differently from Environment 3, and so on. Any environment that satisfies these rules I shall call a Cantgotu environment."
- "Now, since a Cantgotu environment does not behave exactly like Environment 1 , it cannot be Environment 1; since it does not behave exactly like Environment 2, it cannot be Environment 2. Since it is guaranteed sooner or later to behave differently from Environment 3, Environment 4 and every other environment on the list, it cannot be any of those either. But that list contains all the environments that are generated by every possible program for this machine. It follows that none of the Cantgotu environments are in the machine's repertoire. The Cantgotu environments are environments that we can't go to using this virtual-reality generator."
- "there are enormously many cantgotu environments because the definition leaves enormous freedom in choosing how they should behave, the only constraint being that during each minute they should not behave in one particular way. It can be proved that, for every environment in the repertoire of a given virtual-reality generator, there are infinitely many Cantgotu environments that it cannot render.  Nor is there much scope for extending the repertoire by using a range of different virtual-reality generators. Suppose that w e had a hundred o f them, each (for the sake of argument) with a different repertoire. Then the whole collection, combined with the programmable control system that determines which of them shall be used to run a given program, is just a larger virtual-reality generator. That generator is subject to the argument I have given, so for every environment it can render there will be infinitely many that it cannot. Furthermore, the assumption that different virtual-reality generators might have different repertoires turns out to be over-optimistic. As we shall see in a moment, all sufficiently sophisticated virtual-reality generators have essentially the same repertoire."
- Thus our hypothetical project of building the ultimate VR generator, which had been so well, has suddenly run into a brick wall, no matter technological improvement may be made in future, the repertoire will never grow beyond a certain fixed set of environments. admittedly this set is infinitely large but nevertheless it is only an infinitesimal fraction of the set of all logically possible environments.
##### Universal VR generator
- "we must conclude that physics does not allow the repertoire of a virtual-reality generator to be anywhere near as large as logic alone would allow. How large can it be?"
- Since we cannot hope to render all logically possible environments, let us consider a weaker (but ultimately more interesting) sort of universality. Let us define a *universal virtual-reality generator* as one whose repertoire contains that of every other physically possible virtual-reality generator. Can such a machine exist? It can.
- "Thinking about futuristic devices based on computer-controlled nerve stimulation makes this obvious - in fact, almost too obvious. Such a machine could be programmed to have the characteristics of any rival machine. It could calculate how that machine would respond, under any given program, to any behavior by the user, and so could render those responses with perfect accuracy (from the point of view of any given user) . I say that this is 'almost too obvious' because it contains an important assumption about what the proposed device, and more specifically **its computer, could be programmed to do: given the appropriate program, and enough time and storage media, it could calculate the output of any computation performed by any other computer, including the one in the rival virtual-reality generator. Thus the feasibility of a universal virtual-reality generator depends on the existence of a universal computer - a single machine that can calculate anything that can be calculated.**"
##### Computation, Turing machine 
- "this sort of universality was first studied not by physicists but by mathematicians. They were trying to make precise the intuitive notion of 'computing' (or 'calculating' or 'proving') something in mathematics. They did not take on board the fact that mathematical calculation is a physical process (in particular, as I have explained, it is a virtual-reality rendering process) , so it is impossible to determine by mathematical reasoning what can or cannot be calculated mathematically. That depends entirely on the laws of physics. But instead of trying to deduce their results from physical laws, mathematicians postulated abstract models of 'computation', and defined 'calculation' and 'proof ' in terms of those models. (I shall discuss this interesting mistake in Chapter 10.) That is how it came about that over a period of a few months in 1936, three mathematicians, Emil Post, Alonzo Church and, most importantly, Alan Turing, independently created the first abstract designs for universal computers. Each of them conjectured that his model of 'computation' did indeed correctly formalize the traditional, intuitive notion of mathematical 'computation'. Consequently, each of them also conjectured that his model was equivalent to (had the same repertoire as) any other reasonable formalization of the same intuition. This is now known as the Church-Turing conjecture."
- Turing's model of computation, and his conception of the nature of the problem he was solving, was the closest to being physical. His abstract computer, the *Turing machine*, was abstracted from the idea of a paper tape divided into squares, with one of a finite number o f easily distinguishable symbols written o n each square. Computation was performed by examining one square at a time, moving the tape backwards or forwards, and erasing or writing one of the symbols according to simple, unambiguous rules. Turing proved that one particular computer of this type, the *universal Turing machine*, had the combined repertoire of all other Turing machines. He conjectured that this repertoire consisted precisely of 'every function that would naturally be regarded as computable'. He meant *computable by mathematicians*.
- "But mathematicians are rather untypical physical objects. Why should we assume that rendering them in the act of performing calculations is the ultimate in computational tasks? It turns out that it is not. As I shall explain in Chapter 9, quantum computers can perform computations of which no (human) mathematician will ever, even in principle, be capable. *It is implicit in Turing's work that he expected what 'would naturally be regarded as computable' to be also what could, at least in principle, be computed in nature.* This expectation is tantamount to a stronger, physical version of the Church-Turing conjecture."
##### Universality of universal computers
- "The mathematician Roger Penrose has suggested that it should be called the Turing principle: The Turing principle (for abstract computers simulating physical objects) There exists an abstract universal computer whose repertoire includes any computation that any physically possible object can perform."
- an 'environment that can be rendered' does correspond to a class of mathematical questions whose answers can be calculated. Those questions are *computable*. The remainder, the questions for which there is no way of calculating the answer, are called non-computable. but if a question is non-computable that does not mean that it has no answer, or that its answer is in any sense ill-defined or ambiguous. On the contrary, it means that it definitely has an answer. It is just that physically there is no way, even in principle, of obtaining that answer. for example mathematicians tried to answer the question wether there are infinitely many such pairs or finite number of them. even if (suppose) this question is not computable, the question have an answer: either there is a highest prime pair or there are infinitely many prime pairs; there is no third possibility. The question remains well-defined, even though we may never know the answer.
- "the computing power of abstract machines has no bearing on what is computable in reality. The scope of virtual reality, and its wider implications for the comprehensibility of nature and other aspects of the fabric of reality, depends on whether the relevant computers are physically realizable. In particular, any genuine universal computer must itself be physically realizable."
- this lead to stronger version of Turing principle: (for physical computers simulating each other) It is possible to build a universal computer: a machine that can be programmed to perform any computation that any other physical object can perform.
- it also follows from this version of the Turing principle that any physically possible environment can be rendered by the universal virtual-reality generator. Hence to *express the very strong self-similarity that exists in the structure of reality, *embracing not only computations but all physical processes*.
- the Turing principle can be stated in this all-embracing form: 'The Turing principle It is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose repertoire includes every physically possible environment'. This is the strongest form of the Turing principle. It not only tells us that various parts of reality can resemble one another. It tells us that a single physical object, buildable once and for all (apart from maintenance and a supply of additional memory when needed) , can perform with unlimited accuracy the task of describing or mimicking any other part of the multiverse. The set of all behaviors and responses of that one object exactly mirrors the set of all behaviors and responses of all other physically possible objects and processes.
##### David's dropping insight bombs
- "This is just the sort of self-similarity that is necessary if, according to the hope I expressed in Chapter 1, the fabric of reality is to be truly unified and comprehensible."
- If the laws of physics as they apply to any physical object or process are to be comprehensible, they must be capable of being embodied in another physical object - the knower(universal explainer 😌).
- It is also necessary that processes capable of creating such knowledge be physically possible. Such processes are called science. Science depends on experimental testing, which means physically rendering a law's predictions and comparing it with (a rendering of) reality. It also depends on explanation, and that requires the abstract laws themselves, not merely their predictive content, to be capable of being rendered in virtual reality. This is a tall order, but reality does meet it. That is to say, the laws of physics meet it. The laws of physics, by conforming to the Turing principle, make it physically possible for those same laws to become known to physical objects. Thus, the laws of physics may be said to mandate their own comprehensibility.
- we can normally define a physically possible process as one that actually occurs somewhere in the multiverse. ... So what we really mean by saying that it is 'physically possible' is that virtual-reality generators with repertoires arbitrarily close to the set of all physically possible environments exist in the multiverse.
- "since the laws of physics are capable of being rendered, they are rendered somewhere. Thus it follows from the Turing principle (in the strong form for which I have argued) that the laws of physics do not merely mandate their own comprehensibility in some abstract sense - comprehensibility by abstract scientists, as it were. They imply the physical existence, somewhere in the multiverse, of entities that understand them arbitrarily well.
- we do have only virtual reality based on the wrong laws to learn from! As I have said, all our external experiences are of virtual reality, generated by our own brains. And since our concepts and theories (whether inborn or learned) are never perfect, all our renderings are indeed inaccurate."(human fallibility, it is hard to get close to the truth and senses can misleads us).
- "Logically, we must concede to solipsism and related doctrines that the reality we are learning about might be an unrepresentative portion of a larger, inaccessible or incomprehensible structure. But the general refutation that I have given of such doctrines shows us that it is irrational to build upon that possibility. Following Occam, we shall entertain such theories when, and only when, they provide better explanations than simpler rival theories."(Occam's razor is a principle often attributed to. 14th–century friar William of Ockham that says that if you have two competing ideas to explain the same phenomenon, you should prefer the simpler one.)
- "Arthur C. Clarke once remarked that 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic'. This is true, but slightly misleading. It is stated from the point of view of a prescientific thinker, which is the wrong way round. The fact is that to anyone who understands what virtual reality is, even genuine magic would be indistinguishable from technology, for there is no room for magic in a comprehensible reality. Anything that seems incomprehensible is regarded by science merely as evidence that there is something we have not yet understood, be it a conjuring trick, advanced technology or a new law of physics."
- "In the Popperian scheme of things, explanations always lead to new problems which in turn require further explanations. If the prisoners fail, after a while, to improve upon their existing explanations, they may of course give up, perhaps falsely concluding that there are no explanations available. But if they do not give up they will be thinking about those aspects of their environment that seem inadequately explained. Thus if the high-technology jailers wanted to be confident that their rendered environment would forever fool their prisoners into thinking that there is no outside world, they would have their work cut out for them. The longer they wanted the illusion to last, the more ingenious the program would have to be. It is not enough that the inmates be prevented from observing the outside. The rendered environment would also have to be such that no explanations of anything inside would ever require one to postulate an outside. The environment, in other words, would have to be self-contained as regards explanations. But I doubt that any part of reality, short of the whole thing, has that property."(*part* of reality cannot be self-contained and self-explanatory, but whole reality is (hopefully).)
##### Chapter summary
- "The diagonal argument shows that the overwhelming majority of logically possible environments cannot be rendered in virtual reality. I have called them Cantgotu environments. There is nevertheless a comprehensive self-similarity in physical reality that is expressed in the *Turing principle: it is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose repertoire includes every physically possible environment*. So a single, buildable physical object can mimic all the behaviors and responses of any other physically possible object or process. **This is what makes reality comprehensible**."

### Chapter 7 - A Conversation About Justification
note: David used the word *justified* in book that at some points it means justifying something to be true(original meaning in philosophy of science, justificationism) and at some points david by saying something is justified he means it as a moral or methodological claim about what should be done. when he says something is justified what he means is that you should use the best explanation. you are justified in relying upon the best explanation.

##### Purpose of science
- "In Chapter 3 I criticized inductivism, the common-sense idea that we form theories about the physical world by generalizing the results of observations, and that we justify our theories by repeating those observations. I explained that inductive generalization from observations is impossible, and that inductive justification is invalid."
- "I explained that inductivism rests upon a mistaken idea of science as seeking predictions on the basis of observations, rather than as *seeking explanations in response to problems*."
- "I also explained (following Popper) how science does make progress, by *conjecturing new explanations and then choosing between the best ones by experiment*."
- "All this is largely accepted by scientists and philosophers of science. What is not accepted by most philosophers is that this process is justified."(What is not accepted by most philosophers is that this process is the best explanation of how science works.)
##### Philosopher's misconception, problem of induction
- background:
  Induction: 
	- Asserts that we can make predictions about the future based on past observations. 
	-  Suggests that patterns observed in the past will continue into the future.
  Problem of Induction:
	-  Questions the logical justification for assuming that the future will resemble the past.
	- Challenges our ability to guarantee that patterns observed in the past will continue.
	- Asks how we can be certain that our past-based predictions about the future are reliable.
  The relationship:
	1. The problem of induction doesn't say we can't make predictions based on past observations. Rather, it questions our *justification* for doing so.
	2. It doesn't claim that induction doesn't work, but asks why it should work.
	3. The problem highlights that there's no logical necessity for the future to resemble the past, even if it has always done so before.
	4. It points out that using past success to justify future use of induction is circular reasoning.
  In essence, while induction says "we can predict the future based on the past," the problem of induction asks "but how do we know we can reliably do that?" It's not saying prediction is impossible, but rather that we can't provide an absolute, non-circular justification for why such predictions should be reliable.

- according to our best explanation, *induction* isn’t true BTW
- it seems that while philosophers are claiming that they are agree with that induction is invalid but still believe that problem of induction exist and no one have solved it yet.
- modern form of the 'problem of induction': "what justifies our relying on our best explanations as guides to practical decision-making? more generally, whatever criteria we used to judge scientific theories, how could the fact that a theory satisfied those criteria today possibly imply anything about what will happen if we rely on the theory tomorrow?"
- "Most philosophers are now content with Popper's contention that new theories are not inferred from anything, but are merely hypotheses. They also accept that scientific progress is made through conjectures and refutations (as described in Chapter 3 ) , and that theories are accepted when all their rivals are refuted, and not by virtue of numerous confirming instances. They accept that the knowledge obtained in this way tends, in the event, to be reliable. **The problem is that they do not see why it should be.**"
- "Traditional inductivists tried to formulate a 'principle of induction', which said that confirming instances made a theory more likely, or that 'the future will resemble the past'."
- They also tried to formulate a n inductive scientific methodology, laying down rules for what sort of inferences one could validly draw from 'data'. They all failed, for the reasons I have explained. But even if they had succeeded, in the sense of constructing a scheme that could be followed successfully to create scientific knowledge, this would not have solved the problem of induction as it is nowadays understood. For in that case 'induction' would simply be another possible way of choosing theories, and the problem would remain of *why those theories should be a reliable basis for action*. In other words, philosophers who worry about this 'problem of induction' are not inductivists in the old-fashioned sense. They do not try to obtain or justify any theories inductively. **They do not expect the sky to fall in, but they do not know how to justify that expectation.**
- "Philosophers today yearn for this missing justification. They no longer believe that induction would provide it, yet they have an induction-shaped gap in their scheme of things, just as religious people who have lost their faith suffer from a 'God-shaped gap' in their scheme of things. But in my opinion there is little difference between having an X-shaped gap in one's scheme of things and believing in X. Hence to fit in with the more sophisticated conception of the problem of induction, I wish to redefine the term 'inductivist' to mean someone who believes that the invalidity of inductive justification is a problem for the foundations of science. In other words, an inductivist believes that there is a gap which must be filled, if not by a principle of induction then by something else. Some inductivists do not mind being so designated. Others do, so I shall call them crypto-inductivists."
- "The setting is the top of the Eiffel Tower. One of the participants - the 'Floater' - decides to descend by jumping over the side instead of using the lift in the usual way. The others try to persuade the Floater that jumping off means certain death. They use the best available scientific and philosophical arguments. But the infuriating Floater still expects to float down safely, and keeps pointing out that no rival expectation can logically be proved to be preferable on the basis of past experience. 
  I believe that we can justify[justified in relying upon the best explanation] our expectation that the Floater would be killed. The justification (always tentative, of course) comes from the explanations provided by the relevant scientific theories. To the extent that those explanations are good, it is rationally justified to rely on the predictions of corresponding theories. So, in reply to Worrall, I now present a dialogue of my own, set in the same place."
- most philosophers can’t agree on that we can rely upon our best explanation and we correct errors of our explanations as we walk into the future. they don’t know why we should rely on our best existing theories and they think there need to be some process by which we justify as true any given theory that we have at a particular time.
- the heart of the misconception is that philosophers think science is about prediction not explanation and understanding.

##### Notes and excerpts from the conversation 
- "Inductivism said that there is an 'inductive' form of reasoning which can derive, and justify the use of, general theories about the future, given evidence in the form of individual observations made in the past. It held that there was a principle of nature, the principle of induction, which said something like 'observations made in the future are likely to resemble observations made under similar circumstances in the past'. Attempts were made to formulate this in such a way that it would indeed allow one to derive, or justify, general theories from individual observations. They all failed."
- "The problem of induction is not how to justify or refute the principle of induction, but rather, taking for granted that it is invalid, *how to justify any conclusion about the future from past evidence.*"
- "According to Popperian methodology, one should in these cases rely on the best-corroborated theory - that is, the one that has been subjected to the most stringent tests and has survived them while its rivals have been refuted."
- evidence doesn’t justify theory to be true, it only is used to decide between theories already conjectured and to rule out theories, not to justify one theory to be true or more true.
- what is the problem of induction again: "the whole problem is to find what does justify the prediction. That is the problem of induction."
- "the reliability of a theory should depend on what false theories people have proposed in the past."
- "Popperians might speak of a theory being the best available for use in practice, given a certain problem-situation. And the most important features of a problem-situation are: what theories and explanations are in contention, what arguments have been advanced, and what theories have been refuted."
- "I now understand the role of a theory's refuted rivals in the justification of its predictions. Under inductivism, observation was supposed to be primary. One imagined a mass of past observations from which the theory was supposed to be induced, and observations also constituted the evidence which somehow justified the theory. In the Popperian picture of scientific progress, it is not observations but problems, controversies, theories and criticism that are primary. Experiments are designed and performed only to resolve controversies."
- "We do not need (and could not validly get) any assurance about *how good* even the best proposed course of action will be. Furthermore, we may always be mistaken, but so what? We cannot use theories that have yet to be proposed; nor can we correct errors that we cannot yet see."
- "For a theory to win an argument, all its rivals must be untenable, and that includes all the variants of the rivals which anyone has thought of."
- "But not all languages are equal. Languages are theories. In their vocabulary and grammar, they embody substantial assertions about the world. Whenever we state a theory, only a small part of its content is explicit: the rest is carried by the language. Like all theories, languages are invented and selected for their ability to solve certain problems. In this case the problems are those of expressing other theories in forms in which it is convenient to apply them, and to compare and criticize them. One of the most important ways in which languages solve these problems is to embody, implicitly, theories that are uncontroversial and taken for granted, while allowing things that need to be stated or argued about to be expressed succinctly and cleanly."
- "Theories postulating anomalies *without explaining them* are less likely *than their rivals* to make true predictions. More generally, it is a principle of rationality that theories are postulated in order to solve problems. Therefore any postulate which solves no problem is to be rejected. That is because a good explanation qualified by such a postulate becomes a bad explanation."
- "The reverence that philosophers show for the historical sources of ideas is very perverse, you know. In science we do not consider the discoverer of a theory to have any special insight into it. On the contrary, we hardly ever consult original sources. They invariably become obsolete, as the problem-situations that prompted them are transformed by the discoveries themselves. For example, most relativity theorists today understand Einstein's theory better than he did. The founders of quantum theory made a complete mess of understanding their own theory. Such shaky beginnings are to be expected; and when we stand upon the shoulders of giants, it may not be all that hard to see further than they did. But in any case, surely it is more interesting to argue about what the truth is, than about what some particular thinker, however great, did or did not think."
- "Yes, I have justified an assertion about the future. You say this implies that 'the future resembles the past'. Well, vacuously, yes, inasmuch as any theory about the future would assert that it resembled the past in some sense. But this inference that the future resembles the past is not the sought-for principle of induction, for we could neither derive nor justify any theory or prediction about the future from it. For example, we could not use it to distinguish your theory of gravity from the prevailing one, for they both say, in their own way, that the future resembles the past."
- "Nothing in the concepts of 'rational argument' or 'explanation' relates the future to the past in any special way. Nothing is postulated about anything 'resembling' anything. Nothing of that sort would help if it were postulated. In the vacuous sense in which the very concept of 'explanation' implies that the future 'resembles the past', it nevertheless implies nothing specific about the future, so it is not a principle of induction. There is no principle of induction. There is no process of induction. No one ever uses them or anything like them. And there is no longer a problem of induction."
- "The best existing theories, which cannot be abandoned lightly because they are the solutions of problems, contain predictions about the future. And these predictions cannot be severed from the theories' other content, as you tried to do, because that would spoil the theories' explanatory power. Any new theory we propose must therefore either be consistent with these existing theories, which has implications for what the new theory can say about the future, or contradict some existing theories but address the problems thereby raised, giving alternative explanations, which again constrains what they can say about the future."
- "Our theories simply assert something about the future. Vacuously, any theory about the future implies that the future will 'resemble the past' in some ways. But we only find out in what respects the theory says that the future will resemble the past after we have the theory."
- "What justifies the principles of rationality? Argument, as usual. What, for instance, justifies our relying on the laws of *deduction*, despite the fact that any attempt to justify them logically must lead either to circularity or to an infinite regress? They are justified because no explanation is improved by replacing a law of deduction."
- "for logical reasoning is no less a physical process than scientific reasoning is, and it is inherently fallible. The laws of logic are not self-evident."
- "So you don't think that there is a 'problem of deduction', then? No, I don't think that there is a problem with any of the usual ways of justifying conclusions in science, philosophy or mathematics."
- "it is an interesting *fact* that the physical universe admits processes that create knowledge about itself, and about other things too. We may reasonably try to explain this fact in the same way as we explain other physical facts, namely through explanatory theories. ...  I think that the Turing principle is the appropriate theory in this case. It says that it is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose repertoire includes every physically possible environment. If the Turing principle is a law of physics, as I have argued that it is, then we should not be surprised to find that we can form accurate theories about reality, because that is just virtual reality in action. Just as the fact that steam engines are possible is a direct expression of the principles of thermodynamics, so the fact that the human brain is capable of creating knowledge is a direct expression of the Turing principle."
- "Crypto-Inductivist: But how do we know that the Turing principle is true? David: We don't, of course... But you are afraid, aren't you, that if we can't justify the Turing principle, then we shall once again have lost our justification for relying on scientific predictions?"
- "The misconception i s about the very nature o f argument and explanation. You seem to be assuming that arguments and explanations, such as those that justify acting on a particular theory, have the form of mathematical proofs, proceeding from assumptions to conclusions. You look for the 'raw material' (axioms) from which our conclusions (theorems) are derived. Now, there is indeed a logical structure of this type associated with every successful argument or explanation. But the process of argument does not begin with the 'axioms' and end with the 'conclusion'. Rather, it starts in the middle, with a version that is riddled with inconsistencies, gaps, ambiguities and irrelevancies. All these faults are criticized. Attempts are made to replace faulty theories. The theories that are criticized and replaced usually include some of the 'axioms'. That is why it is a mistake to assume that an argument begins with, or is justified by, the theories that eventually serve as its 'axioms'. The argument ends - tentatively - when it seems to have shown that the associated explanation is satisfactory. The 'axioms' adopted are not ultimate, unchallengeable beliefs. They are tentative, explanatory theories."
- "I see. Argument is not the same species of thing as deduction, or the non-existent induction. It is not based on anything or justified by anything. And *it doesn't have to be*, because its purpose is to solve problems - to show that a given problem is solved by a given explanation."
- "We Popperians believe in letting our theories die in our place."

### The Significance of Life

##### Life is a fundamental phenomenon of nature
- "From ancient times until about the nineteenth century, it was taken for granted that some special animating force or factor was required to make the matter in living organisms behave so noticeably differently from other matter. This would mean in effect that there were two types of matter in the universe: *animate matter* and *inanimate matter*, with fundamentally different physical properties. Consider a living organism such as a bear. A photograph of a bear resembles the living bear in some respects. So do other inanimate objects such as a dead bear, or even, in a very limited fashion, the Great Bear constellation. But only animate matter can chase you through the forest as you dodge round trees, and catch you and tear you apart. Inanimate things never do anything as purposeful as that - or so the ancients thought. They had, of course, never seen a guided missile."
- To Aristotle and other ancient philosophers, the most conspicuous feature of animate matter was its ability to initiate motion. They thought that when inanimate matter, such as a rock, has come to rest, it never moves again unless something kicks it. But animate matter, such as a hibernating bear, can be at rest and then begin to move without being kicked. ... he did get one important thing right which most modern thinkers have got wrong. In trying to associate life with a basic physical concept (albeit the wrong one, motion) , he recognized that life is a fundamental phenomenon of nature.
- A phenomenon is 'fundamental' if a sufficiently deep understanding of the world depends on understanding that phenomenon.
- The understanding that I am talking about is expressed in laws of physics, and in principles of logic and philosophy. A 'deeper' understanding is one that has more generality, incorporates more connections between superficially diverse truths, explains more with fewer unexplained assumptions. The most fundamental phenomena are implicated in the explanation of many other phenomena, but are themselves explained only by basic laws and principles.
- "Not all fundamental phenomena have large physical effects. Gravitation does, and is indeed a fundamental phenomenon. But the direct effects of quantum interference, such as the shadow patterns described in Chapter 2., are not large. It is quite hard even to detect them unambiguously. Nevertheless, we have seen that quantum interference is a fundamental phenomenon. Only by understanding it can we understand the basic fact about physical reality, namely the existence of parallel universes."
- "The Copernican revolution made the Earth subsidiary to a central, inanimate Sun. Subsequent discoveries in physics and astronomy showed not only that the universe is vast in comparison with the Earth, but that it is described with enormous accuracy by all-encompassing laws that make no mention of life at all. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution explained the origin of life in terms that required no special physics, and since then we have discovered many of the detailed mechanisms of life, and found no special physics there either."
##### "Nature is physics" misconception
- "These spectacular successes of science, and the great generality of Newtonian and subsequent physics in particular, did much to make reductionism attractive. Since faith in revealed truth had been found to be incompatible with rationality (which requires an openness to criticism), many people nevertheless yearned for an ultimate foundation to things in which they could believe. If they did not yet have a reductive 'theory of everything' to believe in, then at least they aspired to one. It was taken for granted that a reductionist hierarchy of sciences, based on subatomic physics, was integral to the scientific world-view, and so it was criticized only by pseudo-scientists and others who rebelled against science itself. Thus, by the time I learned biology in school, the status of that subject had changed to the opposite of what Aristotle thought was obvious. Life was not considered to be fundamental at all. The very term 'nature study' - meaning biology - had become an anachronism."
- "Fundamentally, nature was physics. I am oversimplifying only a little if I characterize the prevailing view as follows. Physics had an offshoot, chemistry, which studied the interactions of atoms. Chemistry had an offshoot, organic chemistry, which studied the properties of compounds o f the element carbon. Organic chemistry in turn had an offshoot, biology, which studied the chemical processes we call life. Only because we happen to be such a process was this remote offshoot of a fundamental subject interesting to us. Physics, in contrast, was regarded as self-evidently important in its own right because the entire universe, life included, conforms to its principles."
- "The reason why both Aristotle's view and that of my school textbooks failed to capture even a good taxonomic distinction between living and non-living things, let alone anything deeper, is that they both miss the point about what living things are (a mistake more forgivable in Aristotle because in his day no one knew any better). Modern biology does not try to define life by some characteristic physical attribute or substance - some living 'essence' - with which only animate matter is endowed. We no longer expect there to be any such essence, because we now know that 'animate matter', matter in the form of living organisms, is not the basis of life. It is merely one of the effects of life, and the basis of life is molecular. It is the fact that there exist molecules which cause certain environments to make copies of those molecules."
##### a kind of molecules that tend to be replicated
- "Such molecules are called replicators. More generally, a replicator is any entity that causes certain environments to copy it. Not all replicators are biological, and not all replicators are molecules. For example, a self-copying computer program (such as a computer virus) is a replicator. A good joke is another replicator, for it causes its listeners to retell it to further listeners. Richard Dawkins has coined the term *meme* for replicators that are human ideas, such as jokes. But all life on Earth is based on replicators that are molecules. These are called *genes*, and biology is the study of the origin, structure and operation of genes, and of their effects on other matter."
- In most organisms a gene consists of a sequence of smaller molecules, of which there are four different kinds, joined together in a chain. The names of the component molecules (adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine) are usually shortened to A, C, G and T. The abbreviated chemical name for a chain of any number of A, C, G and T molecules, in any order, is DNA.
- Genes are in effect computer programs, expressed as sequences of A, C, G and T symbols in a standard language called the *genetic code* which, with very slight variations, is common to all life on Earth. (Some viruses are based on a related type of molecule, R N A , while prions are, in a sense, self-replicating protein molecules.) Special structures within each organism's cells act as computers to execute these gene programs. The execution consists of manufacturing certain molecules (proteins) from simpler molecules (amino acids) under certain external conditions. For example, the sequence 'A T G ' is an instruction to incorporate the amino acid methionine into the protein molecule being manufactured.
- "A gene can function as a replicator only in certain environments. By analogy with an ecological 'niche' (the set of environments in which an organism can survive and reproduce) , I shall also use the term niche for the set of all possible environments which a given replicator would cause to make copies of it. The niche of an insulin gene includes environments where the gene is located in the nucleus of a cell in the company of certain other genes, and the cell itself is appropriately located within a functioning organism, in a habitat suitable for sustaining the organism's life and reproduction. But there are also other environments - such as biotechnology laboratories in which bacteria are genetically altered so as to incorporate the gene - which likewise copy the insulin gene. Those environments are also part of the gene's niche, as are an infinity of other possible environments that are very different from those in which the gene evolved."
- "Not everything that can be copied is a replicator. A replicator causes its environment to copy it: that is, it contributes causally to its own copying. ... what I mean here is that the presence and specific physical form of the replicator *makes a difference* to whether copying takes place or not. ... The presence of the gene in its proper form and location *makes a difference* to whether copying takes place, which makes it a replicator, though there are countless other causes contributing to its replication as well."
##### Replicator adaption
- "If most variants of the replicator fail to cause most environments of its niche to copy them, then it would follow that our replicator's form is a significant cause of its own copying in that niche, which is what we mean by saying that it is highly adapted to the niche. On the other hand, if most variants of the replicator would be copied in most of the environments of the niche, then the form of our replicator makes little difference, in that copying would occur anyway. In that case, our replicator makes little causal contribution to its copying, and it is not highly adapted to that niche."
- "So the degree of adaptation of a replicator depends not only on what that replicator does in its actual environment, but also on what a vast number of other objects, most of which do not exist, would do, in a vast number of environments other than the actual one. We have encountered this curious sort of property before. The accuracy of a virtual-reality rendering depends not only on the responses the machine actually makes to what the user actually does, but also on responses it does not, in the event, make to things the user does not i n fact do. This similarity between living processes and virtual reality is no coincidence."
##### Notes on replicator and genes
- "The most important factor determining a gene's niche is usually that the gene's replication depends on the presence of other genes. For example, the replication of a bear's insulin gene depends not only on the presence, in the bear's body, of all its other genes, but also on the presence, in the external environment, of genes from other organisms. Bears cannot survive without food, and the genes for manufacturing that food exist only in other organisms."
- "Different types of gene which need each other's cooperation to replicate often live joined together in long DNA chains, the DNA of an organism. An organism i s the sort of thing - such a s an animal, plant or microbe - which in everyday terms we usually think of as being alive. ... *An organism is not a replicator*: it is part of the environment of replicators - usually the most important part after the other genes. The remainder of the environment is the type of habitat that can be occupied by the organism (such as mountain tops or ocean bottoms) and the particular lifestyle within that habitat (such as hunter or filter-feeder) which enables the organism to survive for long enough for its genes to be replicated."
- "In everyday parlance we speak of organisms 'reproducing themselves'; indeed, this was one of the supposed 'characteristics of living things'. In other words, we think of organisms as replicators. But this is inaccurate. Organisms are not copied during reproduction; far less do they cause their own copying. They are constructed afresh according to blueprints embodied in the parent organisms' DNA."
- "For example, if the shape of a bear's nose is altered in an accident, it may change the life-style of that particular bear, and the bear's chances of surviving to 'reproduce itself' may be affected for better or worse. But the bear with the new shape of nose has no chance of being copied. If it does have offspring, they will have noses of the original shape. But make a change in the corresponding gene (if you d o i t just after the bear i s conceived, you need only change one molecule) , and any offspring will not only have noses of the new shape, but copies of the new gene as well. This shows that the shape of each nose is caused by that gene, and not by the shape of any previous nose. So the shape of the bear's nose makes no causal contribution to the shape of the offspring's nose. But the shape of the bear's genes contributes both to their own copying and to the shape of the bear's nose and of its offspring's nose."
- "So an organism is the immediate environment which copies the real replicators: the organism's genes." organisms are just environments in which the genes facilitate their replication.
##### arguments for "Life is insignificant"
- "I now return to the question whether life is a fundamental phenomenon of nature. I have warned against the reductionist assumption that emergent phenomena, such as life, are necessarily less fundamental than microscopic physical ones. Nevertheless, everything I have just been saying about what life is seems to point to its being a mere side-effect at the end of a long chain of side-effects. For it is not merely the predictions of biology that reduce, in principle, to those of physics: it is, on the face of it, also the explanations. As I have said, the great explanatory theories of Darwin (in modern versions such as that propounded by Dawkins) , and of modern biochemistry, are reductive. Living molecules - genes - are merely molecules, obeying the same laws of physics and chemistry as non-living ones. They contain no special substance, nor do they have any special physical attributes. They just happen, in certain environments, to be replicators. The property of being a replicator is highly contextual - that is, it depends on intricate details of the replicator's environment: an entity is a replicator in one environment and not in another. Also, the property of being adapted to a niche does not depend on any simple, intrinsic physical attribute that the replicator has at the time, but on effects that it may cause in the future - and under hypothetical circumstances at that (i.e. in variants of the environment). Contextual and hypothetical properties are essentially derivative, so it is hard to see how a phenomenon characterized only by such properties could possibly be a fundamental phenomenon of nature."
- "As for the physical impact of life, the conclusion is the same: the effects of life seem negligibly small. For all we know, the planet Earth is the only place in the universe where life exists. Certainly we have seen no evidence of its existence elsewhere, so even if it is quite widespread its effects are too small to be perceptible to us. What we do see beyond the Earth is an active universe, seething with diverse, powerful but totally inanimate processes. Galaxies revolve. Stars condense, shine, flare, explode and collapse. High-energy particles and electromagnetic and gravitational waves stream in all directions. Whether life is or is not out there among all those titanic processes seems to make no difference. It seems that none of them would be in the slightest way affected if life were present. If the Earth were enveloped in a large solar flare, itself an insignificant event astrophysically, our biosphere would be instantly sterilized, and that catastrophe would have as little effect on the sun as a raindrop has on an erupting volcano. Our biosphere is, in terms of its mass, energy or any similar astrophysical measure of significance, a negligible fraction even of the Earth, yet it is a truism of astronomy that the solar system consists essentially of the Sun and Jupiter. Everything else (including the Earth) is 'just impurities'. Moreover, the solar system is a negligible component of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, which is itself unremarkable among the many in the known universe. So it seems that, as Stephen Hawking put it, 'The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting round a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies.' 
  Thus the prevailing view today is that life, far from being central, either geometrically, theoretically or practically, is of almost inconceivable insignificance. Biology, in this picture, is a subject with the same status as geography. Knowing the layout of the city of Oxford is important to those of us who live there, but unimportant to those who never visit Oxford. Similarly, it seems that life is a property of some parochial area, or perhaps areas, of the universe, fundamental to us because we are alive, but not at all fundamental either theoretically or practically in the larger scheme of things."
##### Genes and virtual reality, Genes embody knowledge!
- "let me explain my earlier remark that life is a form of virtual-reality generation. I have used the word 'computers' for the mechanisms that execute gene programs inside living cells, but that is slightly loose terminology. Compared with the general-purpose computers that we manufacture artificially, they do more in some respects and less in others. One could not easily program them to do word processing or to factorize large numbers. On the other hand, they exert exquisitely accurate, interactive control over the responses of a complex environment (the organism) to everything that may happen to it. And this control is directed towards causing the environment to act back upon the genes in a specific way (namely, to replicate them) such that the net effect on the genes is as independent as possible of what may be happening outside. This is more than just computing. It is virtual-reality rendering."
- "all virtual-reality rendering physically manufactures the rendered environment. The inside of any virtual-reality generator in the act of rendering is precisely a real, physical environment, manufactured to have the properties specified in the program. ... It is just that we users sometimes choose to interpret it as a different environment, which happens to feel the same. As for the absence of a user, let us consider explicitly what the role of the user of virtual reality is. First, it is to kick the rendered environment and to be kicked back in return - in other words, to interact with the environment in an autonomous way. In the biological case, that role is performed by the external habitat. Second, it is to provide the intention behind the rendering. That is to say, it makes little sense to speak of a particular situation as being a virtual-reality rendering if there is no concept of the rendering being accurate or inaccurate. I have said that the accuracy of a rendering is the closeness, as perceived by the user, of the rendered environment to the intended one. But what does accuracy mean for a rendering which no one intended and no one perceives? It means the degree of adaptation of the genes to their niche. We can infer the 'intention' of genes to render an environment that will replicate them, from Darwin's theory of evolution. Genes become extinct if they do not enact that 'intention' as efficiently or resolutely as other competing genes."
- "So living processes and virtual-reality renderings are, superficial differences aside, the same sort of process. Both involve the physical embodying of general theories about an environment. In both cases these theories are used to realize that environment and to control, interactively, not just its instantaneous appearance but also its detailed response to general stimuli."
- "***Genes embody knowledge about their niches***. Everything of fundamental significance about the phenomenon of life depends on this property, and not on replication per se. So we can now take the discussion beyond replicators. I n principle, one could imagine a species whose genes were unable to replicate, but instead were adapted to keep their physical form unchanged by continual self-maintenance and by protecting themselves from external influences. Such a species is unlikely to evolve naturally, but it might be constructed artificially. Just as the degree of adaptation of a replicator is defined as the degree to which it contributes causally to its own replication, we can define the degree of adaptation of these non-replicating genes as the degree to which they contribute to their own survival in a particular form. Consider a species whose genes were patterns etched in diamond. An ordinary diamond with a haphazard shape might survive for aeons under a wide range of circumstances, but that shape is not adapted for survival because a differently shaped diamond would also survive under similar circumstances. But if the diamond-encoded genes of our hypothetical species caused the organism to behave in a way which, for instance, protected the diamond's etched surface from corrosion in a hostile environment, or defended it against other organisms that would try to etch different information into it, or against thieves who would cut and polish it into a gemstone, then it would contain genuine adaptations for survival in those environments. (Incidentally, a gemstone does have a degree of adaptation for survival in the environment of present-day Earth. Humans seek out uncut diamonds and change their shapes to those of gemstones. But they seek out gemstones and preserve their shapes. So in this environment, the shape of a gemstone contributes causally to its own survival.)"
- "When the manufacture of these artificial organisms ceased, the number of instances of each non-replicating gene could never again increase. But nor would it decrease, so long as the knowledge it contained was sufficient for it to enact its survival strategy in the niche it occupied. Eventually a sufficiently large change in the habitat, or attrition caused by accidents, might wipe out the species, but it might well survive for as long as many a naturally occurring species. The genes of such species share all the properties of real genes except replication. In particular, they embody the knowledge necessary to render their organisms in just the way that real genes do.
  It is the *survival of knowledge*, and not necessarily of the gene or any other physical object, that is the common factor between replicating and non-replicating genes. So, strictly speaking, it is a piece of knowledge rather than a physical object that is or is not adapted to a certain niche. If it is adapted, then it has the property that once it is embodied in that niche, it will tend to remain so. With a replicator, the physical material that embodies it keeps changing, a new copy being assembled out of non-replicating components every time replication occurs. Non-replicating knowledge may also be successively embodied in different physical forms, as for example when a vintage sound recording is transferred from a vinyl record to magnetic tape, and later to compact disc. One could imagine another artificial non-replicator-based living organism that did the same sort of thing, taking every opportunity to recopy the knowledge in its genes onto the safest medium available. Perhaps one day our descendants will do that."
##### Life is about knowledge
- "The point is that although all known life is based on replicators, what the phenomenon of life is really about is knowledge. We can give a definition of adaptation directly in terms of knowledge: an entity is adapted to its niche if it embodies knowledge that causes the niche to keep that knowledge in existence. Now we are getting closer to the reason why life is fundamental."
- "Life is about the physical embodiment of knowledge, and in Chapter 6 we came across a law of physics, the Turing principle, which is also about the physical embodiment of knowledge. It says that it is possible to embody the laws of physics, as they apply to every physically possible environment, in programs for a virtual-reality generator. Genes are such programs. Not only that, but all other virtual-reality programs that physically exist, or will ever exist, are direct or indirect effects of life. For example, the virtual-reality programs that run on our computers and in our brains are indirect effects of human life. So life is the means - presumably a necessary means - by which the effects referred to i n the Turing principle have been implemented in nature."
- "But the sceptic would be wrong [that knowledge is a parochial, anthropocentric concept rather than a fundamental one]. Knowledge is significant not only to Homo sapiens, nor only on the planet Earth. I have said that whether something does or does not have a large physical impact is not decisive as to whether it is fundamental in nature. But it is relevant. Let us consider the astrophysical effects of knowledge. The theory of stellar evolution - the structure and development of stars - is one of the success stories of science. (Note the clash of terminology here. The word 'evolution' in physics means development, or simply motion, not variation and selection.) Only a century ago, even the source of the Sun's energy was unknown. The best physics of the day provided only the false conclusion that whatever its energy source was, the Sun could not have been shining for more than a hundred million years. Interestingly, the geologists and palaeontologists already knew, from fossil evidence of what life had been doing, that the Sun must have been shining on the Earth for a billion years at least. Then nuclear physics was discovered, and was applied in great detail to the physics of the interiors of stars. Since then the theory of stellar evolution has matured. We now understand what makes a star shine. For most types of star we can predict what temperature, color, luminosity and diameter it has at each stage of its history, how long each stage lasts, what elements the star creates by nuclear transmutation, and s o on. This theory has been tested and borne out by observations of the Sun and other stars.
  We can use the theory to predict the future development of the Sun. It says that the Sun will continue to shine with great stability for another five billion years or so; then it will expand to about a hundred times its present diameter to become a red giant star; then it will pulsate, flare into a nova, collapse and cool, eventually becoming a black dwarf. But will all this really happen to the Sun? Has every star that formed a few billion years before the Sun, with the same mass and composition, already become a red giant, as the theory predicts? Or is it possible that some apparently insignificant chemical processes on minor planets orbiting those stars might alter the course of nuclear and gravitational processes having overwhelmingly more mass and energy?"
##### Life is about knowledge and knowledge is fundamental
- "It seems likely that the knowledge required to control the Sun in this way could not evolve by natural selection alone, so it must specifically be *intelligent* life on whose presence the future of the Sun depends"
- "there is every reason to conjecture that our descendants will eventually control the Sun and much more. Admittedly, we can foresee neither their technology nor their wishes. They may choose to save themselves by emigrating from the solar system, or by refrigerating the Earth, or by any number of methods, inconceivable to us, that do not involve tampering with the Sun. On the other hand, they may wish to control the Sun much sooner than would be required to prevent it from entering its red giant phase (for example to harness its energy more efficiently, or to quarry it for raw materials to construct more living space for themselves). However, the point I am making here does not depend on our being able to predict what will happen, but only on the proposition that what will happen will depend on what knowledge our descendants have, and on how they choose to apply it. Thus one cannot predict the future of the Sun without taking a position on the future of life on Earth, and in particular on the future of knowledge."
- "The color of the Sun ten billion years hence depends on gravity and radiation pressure, on convection and nucleosynthesis. It does not depend at all on the geology of Venus, the chemistry of Jupiter, or the pattern of craters on the Moon. But it does depend on what happens to intelligent life on the planet Earth. It depends on politics and economics and the outcomes of wars. It depends on what people do: what decisions they make, what problems they solve, what values they adopt, and on how they behave towards their children."
- "One cannot avoid this conclusion by adopting a pessimistic theory of the prospects for our survival. Such a theory does not follow from the laws of physics or from any other fundamental principle that we know, and can be justified only in high-level, human terms (such as 'scientific knowledge has outrun moral knowledge', or whatever) . So, in arguing from such a theory one is implicitly conceding that theories of human affairs are necessary for making astrophysical predictions. And even if the human race will in the event fail in its efforts to survive, does the pessimistic theory apply to every extraterrestrial intelligence in the universe? If not - if some intelligent life, in some galaxy, will ever succeed in surviving for billions of years - then life is significant in the gross physical development of the universe."
- "The cosmologists John Barrow and Frank Tipler have considered the astrophysical effects that life would have if it survived for long after the time at which the Sun would otherwise become a red giant. They have found that life would eventually make major, qualitative changes to the structure of the Galaxy, and later to the structure of the whole universe. (I shall return to these results in Chapter 14.) So once again, any theory of the structure of the universe in all but its earliest stages must take a position on what life will or will not be doing by then. There is no getting away from it: the future history of the universe depends on the future history of knowledge. Astrologers used to believe that cosmic events influence human affairs; science believed for centuries that neither influences the other. Now we see that human affairs influence cosmic events."
- "Life achieves its effects not by being larger, more massive or more energetic than other physical processes, but by being more knowledgeable. In terms of its gross effect on the outcomes of physical processes, knowledge is at least as significant as any other physical quantity."
##### knowledge is like a crystal in the multiverse
- information flow is happening in the multiverse and every useful information - knowledge - tends to get itself replicated and copied and knowledge is a structure tends grows across the multiverse like a crystal in the multiverse.
- "Again we were too parochial, and were led t o the false conclusion that knowledge-bearing entities can be physically identical to non-knowledge-bearing ones; and this in turn cast doubt on the fundamental status of knowledge. But now we have come almost full circle. We can see that the ancient idea that living matter has special physical properties was almost true: it is not living matter but knowledge-bearing matter that is physically special. Within one universe it looks irregular; across universes it has a regular structure, like a crystal in the multiverse."
- "So knowledge is a fundamental physical quantity after all, and the phenomenon of life is only slightly less so."
##### Life and Thought determines the fate of cosmos
- "Finally, let us look around the universe in a similar way. What will catch our magically enhanced eye? In a single universe the most striking structures are galaxies and clusters of galaxies. But those objects have no discernible structure across the multiverse. Where there is a galaxy in one universe, a myriad galaxies with quite different geographies are stacked in the multiverse. And so it is everywhere in the multiverse. Nearby universes are alike only in certain gross features, as required by the laws of physics, which apply to them all. Thus most stars are quite accurately spherical everywhere in the multiverse, and most galaxies are spiral or elliptical . But nothing extends far into other universes without its detailed structure changing unrecognizably. Except, that is, in those few places where there is embodied knowledge. In such places, objects extend recognizably across large numbers of universes. Perhaps the Earth is the only such place in our universe, at present. In any case, such places stand out, in the sense I have described, as the location of the processes - life, and thought - that have generated the largest distinctive structures in the multiverse."
##### Summary
- "Scientific progress since Galileo has seemed to refute the ancient idea that life is a fundamental phenomenon of nature. It has revealed the vast scale of the universe, compared with the Earth's biosphere. Modern biology seems to have confirmed this refutation, by explaining living processes in terms of molecular replicators, genes, whose behavior is governed by the same laws of physics as apply to inanimate matter. Nevertheless, life is associated with a fundamental principle of physics - the Turing principle - since it is the means by which virtual reality was first realized in nature. Also, despite appearances, life is a significant process on the largest scales of both time and space. The future behavior of life will determine the future behavior of stars and galaxies. And the largest-scale regular structure across universes exists where knowledge-bearing matter, such as brains or DNA gene segments, has evolved."
### Quantum Computers
##### kinds and forms of computation
- "To anyone new to the subject, quantum computation sounds like the name of a new technology - the latest, perhaps, in the remarkable succession that has included mechanical computation, transistorized electronic computation, silicon-chip computation, and so on."
- mechanical computation, transistorized electronic computation, silicon-chip computation, chemical computer
- quantum computation
##### Quantum computation
- "Quantum computation is more than just a faster, more miniaturized technology for implementing Turing machines. A quantum computer is a machine that uses uniquely quantum-mechanical effects, especially interference, to perform wholly new types of computation that would be impossible, even in principle, on any Turing machine and hence on any classical computer. Quantum computation is therefore nothing less than a distinctively new way of harnessing nature."
##### Automation
- "The earliest inventions for harnessing nature were tools powered by human muscles. They revolutionized our ancestors' situation, but they suffered from the limitation that they required continuous human attention and effort during every moment of their use. Subsequent technology overcame that limitation: human beings managed to domesticate certain animals and plants, turning the biological adaptations in those organisms to human ends. Thus the crops could grow, and the guard dogs could watch, even while their owners slept. Another new type of technology began when human beings went beyond merely exploiting existing adaptations (and existing non-biological phenomena such as fire) , and created completely new adaptations in the world, in the form of pottery, bricks, wheels, metal artifacts and machines. To do this they had to think about, and understand, the natural laws governing the world - including, as I have explained, not only its superficial aspects but the underlying fabric of reality. There followed thousands of years of progress in this type of technology - harnessing some of the materials, forces and energies of physics. In the twentieth century information was added to this list when the invention of computers allowed complex information processing to be performed outside human brains."
##### Quantum computer
- "Quantum computation, which is now in its early infancy, is a distinct further step in this progression. It will be the first technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between parallel universes. A quantum computer would be capable of distributing components of a complex task among vast numbers of parallel universes, and then sharing the results."
##### computation and evaluation, emergent
- "Thus the fact that there are complex organisms, and that there has been a succession of gradually improving inventions and scientific theories (such a s Galilean mechanics, Newtonian mechanics, Einsteinian mechanics, quantum mechanics, . . . ) tells us something more about what sort of computational universality exists in reality. It tells us that the actual laws of physics are, thus far at least, capable of being successively approximated by theories that give ever better explanations and predictions, and that the task of discovering each theory, given the previous one, has been computationally tractable, given the previously known laws and the previously available technology. The fabric of reality must be, as it were, layered, for easy self-access. Likewise, if we think of evolution itself as a computation, it tells us that there have been sufficiently many viable organisms, coded for by DNA , to allow better-adapted ones to be computed (i.e. to evolve) using the resources provided by their worse-adapted predecessors. So we can infer that the laws of physics, in addition to mandating their own comprehensibility through the Turing principle, ensure that the corresponding evolutionary processes, such as life and thought, are neither too time-consuming nor require too many resources of any other kind to occur in reality."
- the laws of physics not only permit (or, as I have argued, require) the existence of life and thought, they require them to be, in some appropriate sense, efficient. To express this crucial property of reality, modern analyses of universality usually postulate computers that are universal in an even stronger sense than the Turing principle would, on the face of it, require: not only are universal virtual-reality generators possible, it is possible to build them so that they do not require impracticably large resources to render simple aspects of reality. From now on, when I refer to universality I shall mean it in this sense, unless otherwise stated.
##### Quantum theory is not a theory of Randomness, it is theory of objective determinism 
- "The laws of quantum mechanics require an object that is initially at a given position (in all universes) to 'spread out' in the multiverse sense. For instance, a photon and its other-universe counterparts all start from the same point on a glowing filament, but then move in trillions of different directions. When we later make a measurement of what has happened, we too become differentiated as each copy of us sees what has happened in our particular universe. If the object in question is the Earth's atmosphere, then a hurricane may have occurred in 30 per cent of universes, say, and not in the remaining 70 per cent. Subjectively we perceive this as a single, unpredictable or 'random' outcome, though from the multiverse point of view all the outcomes have actually happened. This parallel-universe multiplicity is the real reason for the unpredictability of the weather."

##### Quantum system and classical systems
- "It is perhaps worth stressing the distinction between unpredictability and intractability. Unpredictability has nothing to do with the available computational resources. Classical systems are unpredictable (or would be, if they existed) because of their sensitivity to initial conditions. Quantum systems do not have that sensitivity, but are unpredictable because they behave differently in different universes, and so appear random in most universes. In neither case will any amount of computation lessen the unpredictability. Intractability, by contrast, is a computational-resource issue. It refers to a situation where we could readily make the prediction if only we could perform the required computation, but we cannot do so because the resources required are impractically large. In order to disentangle the problems of unpredictability from those of intractability in quantum mechanics, we have to consider quantum systems that are, in principle, predictable."
##### Mysteries of Quantum theory and multiverse, Mach–Zehnder interferometer
- read page 204.
##### Why computing how typical quantum system will behave is intractable
- "The complexity of this sort of computation shows us that there is a lot more happening in a quantum-mechanical environment than - literally - meets the eye. And I have argued, expressing Dr Johnson's criterion for reality in terms of computational complexity, that this complexity is the core reason why it does not make sense to deny the existence of the rest of the multiverse. But far higher multiplicities are possible when there are two or more interacting particles involved in an interference phenomenon. Suppose that each of two interacting particles has (say) a thousand paths open to it. The pair can then be in a million different states at an intermediate stage of the experiment, so there can be up to a million universes that differ in what this pair of particles is doing. If three particles were interacting, the number of different universes could be a billion; for four, a trillion; and so on. Thus the number of different histories that we have to calculate if we want to predict what will happen in such cases increases exponentially with the number of interacting particles. That is why the task of computing how a typical quantum system will behave is well and truly intractable."
##### Universal quantum computer
- "But the point of universality is that it should be possible to program a single machine, specified once and for all, to perform any possible computation, or render any physically possible environment. In 1985 I proved that under quantum physics there is a universal quantum computer. The proof was fairly straightforward. All I had to do was mimic Turing's constructions, but using quantum theory to define the underlying physics instead of the classical mechanics that Turing had implicitly assumed. A universal quantum computer could perform any computation that any other quantum computer (or any Turing-type computer) could perform, and it could render any finite physically possible environment in virtual reality. Moreover, it has since been shown that the time and other resources that it would need to do these things would not increase exponentially with the size or detail of the environment being rendered, so the relevant computations would be tractable by the standards of complexity theory."
##### Quantum theory of computation as fundamental explanation
- "Experimental and theoretical research in the field of quantum computation is accelerating world-wide. Ever more promising new technologies for realizing quantum computers are being proposed, and new types of quantum computation with various advantages over classical computation are continually being discovered and analyzed. I find all these developments very exciting, and I believe that some of them will bear technological fruit. But as far as this book is concerned, that is a side-issue. From a fundamental standpoint it does not matter how useful quantum computation turns out to be, nor does it matter whether we build the first universal quantum computer next week, or centuries from now, or never. The quantum theory of computation must in any case be an integral part of the world-view of anyone who seeks a fundamental understanding of reality. What quantum computers tell us about connections between the laws of physics, universality, and apparently unrelated strands of explanation of the fabric of reality, we can discover - and are already discovering - by studying them theoretically."
##### Summary
- "The laws of physics permit computers that can render every physically possible environment without using impractically large resources. So universal computation is not merely possible, as required by the Turing principle, it is also tractable. Quantum phenomena may involve vast numbers of parallel universes and therefore may not be capable of being efficiently simulated within one universe. However, this strong form of universality still holds because quantum computers can efficiently render every physically possible quantum environment, even when vast numbers of universes are interacting. Quantum computers can also efficiently solve certain mathematical problems, such as factorization, which are classically intractable, and can implement types of cryptography which are classically impossible. Quantum computation is a qualitatively new way of harnessing nature."
### The Nature of Mathematics
*The next chapter is likely to provoke many mathematicians. This can't be helped. Mathematics is not what they think it is.* 
*(Readers who are unfamiliar with traditional assumptions about the certainty of mathematical knowledge may consider the chapter's main conclusion - that our knowledge of mathematical truth depends on, and is no more reliable than, our knowledge of the physical world - to be obvious. Such readers may pref er to skim this chapter and hurry on to the discussion of time in Chapter 11 .)*

##### Do abstract, non-physical entities exist?
- There are entities that are nowhere to be found in the physical world, abstraction such as numbers and infinite sets of computer programs.
- Galileo's 'The Book of Nature is written in the language of mathematics' is only a metaphor.
- "And then there are the fictions f virtual reality, the non-existent environments whose laws differ from the real laws of physics. Beyond those are what I have called the 'Cantgotu' environments, which cannot even be rendered in virtual reality. I have said that there exist infinitely many of those for every environment that can be rendered. But what does it mean to say that such environments 'exist'? If they do not exist in reality, or even in virtual reality, where do they exist?"
- Do abstract, non-physical entities exist? Are they part of the fabric of reality? how are we to understand such entities? Which are merely ephemeral features of our culture? Which are arbitrary, like the rules of a trivial game that we need only look up? And which, if any, can be explained only in a way that attributes an independent existence to them? Things of this last type must be part of the fabric of reality as defined in this book, because one would have t o understand them in order to understand everything that is understood.
- Let's apply Dr Johnson’s criterion to see if a given abstraction really exists, For example, mathematicians characterize the 'natural numbers' 1, 2, 3, ... in the first instance through a precise definition
  such as:
  1 is a natural number.
  Each natural number has precisely one successor, which is also a natural number.
  1 is not the successor of any natural number.
  Two natural numbers with the same successor are the same.
  
  Such definitions are attempts to express abstractly the intuitive physical notion of successive amounts of a discrete quantity. (More precisely, as I explained in the previous chapter, that notion is really quantum-mechanical.) The operations of arithmetic, such as multiplication and addition, and further concepts such as that of a prime number, are then defined with reference to the 'natural numbers'.
  But with all these definitions, we know that there are a lot more that we still do no understand about them. The definition of a prime number fixes once and for all which numbers are primes and which are not. But the understanding of which numbers are prime - for instance, how prime numbers are distributed on very large scales, how clumped they are, how 'random' they are, and why - involves a wealth of new insights and new explanations.
  To understand numbers more fully we have to define many new classes of abstract entities, and postulate many new structures and connections among those structures. We find that some of these abstract structures are related to other intuitions that we already had but which, on the face of it, had nothing todo with numbers - such as symmetry, rotation, the continuum, sets, infinity, and many more. Thus, abstract mathematical entities we think we are familiar with can nevertheless surprise or disappoint us. They can pop up unexpectedly in new guises, or disguises. They can be inexplicable, and then later conform to a new explanation. So they are complex and autonomous, and therefore by Dr Johnson's criterion we must conclude that they are real.
- Since we cannot understand them either as being part of ourselves or as being part of something else that we already understand, but we can understand them as independent entities, we must conclude that they are real, independent entities.

##### Proof, absolute certainty, fallibility
- "Nevertheless, abstract entities are intangible. They do not kick back physically in the sense that a stone does, so experiment and observation cannot play quite the same role in mathematics as they do in science. In mathematics, *proof* plays that role. Prime numbers kick back when we prove something unexpected about them - especially if we can go on to explain it too."
- "In the traditional view, the crucial difference between proof and experiment is that a proof makes no reference to the physical world. We can perform a proof in the privacy of our own minds, or we can perform a proof trapped inside a virtual-reality generator rendering the wrong physics. Provided only that we follow the rules of mathematical inference, we should come up with the same answer as anyone else. And again, the prevailing view is that, apart from the possibility of making blunders, when we have proved something we know with *absolute certainty* that it is true."
- "It is said that the rules of logic were first formulated in the hope that they would provide an impartial and infallible method of resolving all disputes. This hope can never be fulfilled. The study of logic itself revealed that the scope of logical deduction as a means of discovering the truth is severely limited. Given substantive assumptions about the world, one can deduce conclusions; but the conclusions are no more secure than the assumptions. The only propositions that logic can prove without recourse to assumptions are tautologies - statements such as 'all planets are planets', which assert nothing."
- "In particular, all substantive questions of science lie outside the domain in which logic alone can settle disputes. But mathematics, it is supposed, lies inside that domain. Thus mathematicians seek absolute but abstract truth, while scientists console themselves with the thought that they can gain substantive and useful knowledge of the physical world. But they must accept that this knowledge comes without guarantees. It is forever tentative, forever fallible. The idea that science is characterized by 'induction', a method of justification which is supposed to be a slightly fallible analogue of logical deduction, is an attempt to make the best of this perceived second-class status of scientific knowledge. Instead of deductively justified certainties, perhaps we can make do with inductively justified near-certainties."
- "As I have said, there is no such method of justification as 'induction'. The idea of reasoning one's way to 'near-certainty' in science is myth. How could I prove with 'near-certainty' that a wonderful new theory of physics, overturning my most unquestioned assumptions about reality, will not be published tomorrow? Or that I am not inside a virtual-reality generator? But all this is not to say that scientific knowledge i s indeed 'second-class'. For the idea that mathematics yields certainties is a myth too."

##### Mathematical intuition
- " the problem he posed - of how we can possibly have knowledge, let alone certainty, of abstract entities - is real enough, and some elements of his proposed solution have been part of the prevailing theory of knowledge ever since. In particular, the core idea that mathematical knowledge and scientific knowledge come from *different sources*, and that the 'special' source of mathematics confers absolute certainty upon it, is to this day accepted uncritically by virtually all mathematicians. Nowadays they call this source mathematical intuition, but it plays exactly the same role as Plato's 'memories' of the realm of Forms."
- "As mathematical reasoning became more sophisticated, it inevitably moved ever further away from everyday intuition, and this had two important, opposing effects. First, mathematicians became more meticulous about proofs, which were subjected to ever increasing standards of rigour before they were accepted. But second, more powerful methods of proof were invented which could not always be validated by existing methods. And that often raised doubts as to whether a particular method of proof, however self-evident, was completely infallible."

##### Crisis at the foundations of mathematics
- "So by about 1900 there was a crisis at the foundations of mathematics namely, that there were no foundations. But what had become of the laws of pure logic? Were they not supposed to resolve all disputes within the realm of mathematics ? The embarrassing fact was that the 'laws of pure logic' were in effect what the disputes in mathematics were now about."
- "Aristotle had been the first to codify such laws in the fourth century BC , and so founded what is today called proof theory. He assumed that a proof must consist of a sequence of statements, starting with some premises and definitions and ending with the desired conclusion. For a sequence of statements to be a valid proof, each statement, apart from the premises at the beginning, had to follow from previous ones according to one of a fixed set of patterns called syllogisms."
- "Aristotle had declared that all valid proofs could be expressed in syllogistic form. But he had not proved this! And the problem for proof theory was that very few modern mathematical proofs were expressed purely as a sequence of syllogisms; nor could many of them be recast in that form, even in principle."
- "New tools such as symbolic logic and set theory allowed mathematicians to relate mathematical structures to one another in new ways. This had created new self-evident truths that were independent of the classical rules of inference, so those classical rules were self-evidently inadequate. But which of the new methods of proof were genuinely infallible? How were the rules of inference to be modified so that they would have the completeness that Aristotle had mistakenly claimed? How could the absolute authority of the old rules ever be regained if mathematicians could not agree on what was self-evident and what was nonsense?"
- "Meanwhile, mathematicians were continuing to construct their abstract castles in the sky. For practical purposes many of these constructs seemed sound enough. Some had become indispensable in science and technology, and most were connected by a beautiful and fruitful explanatory structure. Nevertheless, no one could guarantee that the entire structure, or any substantial part of it, was not founded upon a logical contradiction, which would make it literally nonsense. In 1902 Bertrand Russell proved that a scheme for defining set theory rigorously, which had just been proposed by the German logician Gottlob Frege, was inconsistent. This did not mean that it was necessarily invalid to use sets in proofs. Indeed, very few mathematicians seriously supposed that any of the usual ways of using sets, or arithmetic, or other core areas of mathematics, might be invalid. What was shocking about Russell's result was that mathematicians had believed their subject to be par excellence the means of delivering absolute certainty through the proofs of mathematical theorems. The very possibility of controversy over the validity of different methods. of proof undermined the whole purpose (as it was supposed) of the subject."
- To put it simply, there were different types of proof and it seemed there were no guarantee and validity of each method also they were inconsistent with each other, so: "Many mathematicians therefore felt that it was a matter of urgency to place proof theory, and thereby mathematics itself, on a secure foundation. They wanted to consolidate after their headlong advances: to define once and for all which types of proof were absolutely secure, and which were not. Whatever was outside the secure zone could be dropped, and whatever was inside would be the sole basis of all future mathematics."
##### Intuitionism
- "the Dutch mathematician Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer advocated an extreme conservative strategy for proof theory, known as intuitionism, which still has adherents to this day. Intuitionists try to construe 'intuition' in the narrowest conceivable way, retaining only what they consider to be its unchallengeably self-evident aspects. Then they elevate mathematical intuition, thus defined, to a status higher even than Plato afforded it: they regard it as being prior even to pure logic. Thus they regard logic itself as untrustworthy, except where it is justified by direct mathematical intuition. For instance, intuitionists deny that it is possible to have a direct intuition of any infinite entity. Therefore they deny that any infinite sets, such as the set of all natural numbers, exist at all. The proposition 'there exist infinitely many natural numbers' they would consider self-evidently false. And the proposition 'there exist more Cantgotu environments than physically possible environments' they would consider completely meaningless."
- "Historically, intuitionism played a valuable liberating role, just as inductivism did. It dared to question received certainties - some of which were indeed false. But as a positive theory of what is or is not a valid mathematical proof, it is worthless. Indeed, intuitionism is precisely the expression, in mathematics, of solipsism. In both cases there is an over-reaction to the thought that we cannot be sure of what we know about the wider world. In both cases the proposed solution is to retreat into an inner world which we can supposedly know directly and therefore (?) can be sure of knowing truly. In both cases the solution involves either denying the existence - or at least renouncing explanation - of what lies outside. And in both cases this renunciation also makes it impossible to explain much of what lies inside the favored domain."
- "For instance, if it is indeed false, as intuitionists maintain, that there exist infinitely many natural numbers, then we can infer that there must be only finitely many of them. How many? And then, however many there are, why can we not form an intuition of the next natural number above that one? Intuitionists would explain this problem away by pointing out that the argument I have just given assumes the validity of ordinary logic. In particular, it involves inferring, from the fact that there are not infinitely many natural numbers, that there must be some particular finite number of them. The relevant rule of inference is called the *law of the excluded middle*. It says that, for any proposition X (such as 'there are infinitely many natural numbers'), there is no third possibility between X being true and its negation ('there are finitely many natural numbers') being true. Intuitionists coolly deny the law of the excluded middle."
- "intuitionism does exactly what the Inquisition did, and what solipsists do: it retreats still further from explanation. It introduces further unexplained complications (in this case the denial of the law of the excluded middle) whose only purpose is to allow intuitionists to behave as if their opponents' explanation were true, while drawing no conclusions about reality from this."
- "Just as solipsism starts with the motivation of simplifying a frighteningly diverse and uncertain world, but when taken seriously turns out to be realism plus some unnecessary complications, so intuitionism ends up being one of the most counter-intuitive doctrines that has ever been seriously advocated."
##### Hilbert's plan and problems
- "David Hilbert proposed a much more commonsensical - but still ultimately doomed - plan to 'establish once and for all the certitude of mathematical methods'. Hilbert's plan was based on the idea of consistency. He hoped to lay down, once and for all, a complete set of modern rules of inference for mathematical proofs, with certain properties. They would be finite in number. They would be straightforwardly applicable, so that determining whether any purported proof satisfied them or not would be an uncontroversial exercise."
- "He would be satisfied if the rules corresponded only moderately well to intuition, provided that he could be sure that they were self-consistent. That is, if the rules designated a given proof as valid, he wanted to be sure that they could never designate any proof with the opposite conclusion as valid. How could he be sure of such a thing? This time, consistency would have to be *proved*, using a method of proof which itself adhered to the same rules of inference."
- "Then Hilbert hoped that Aristotelian completeness and certainty would be restored, and that every true mathematical statement would in principle be provable under the rules, and that no false statement would be. In 1900, to mark the turn of the century, Hilbert published a list of problems that he hoped mathematicians might be able to solve during the course of the twentieth century. The tenth problem was to find a set of rules of inference with the above properties, and, by their own standards, to prove them consistent."
- "Hilbert was to be definitively disappointed."
##### Kurt Gödel
- "Thirty-one years later, Kurt Gödel revolutionized proof theory with a root-and-branch refutation from which the mathematical and philosophical worlds are still reeling: he proved that Hilbert's tenth problem is insoluble."
- "Gödel proved first that any set of rules of inference that is capable of correctly validating even the proofs of ordinary arithmetic could never validate a proof of its own consistency. Therefore there is no hope of finding the provably consistent set of rules that Hilbert envisaged."
- "Second, Gödel proved that if a set of rules of inference in some (sufficiently rich) branch of mathematics is consistent (whether provably so or not) , then within that branch of mathematics there must exist valid methods of proof that those rules fail to designate as valid."
- CANNOT be both complete and consistent (First Incompleteness Theorem)
- CANNOT prove their own consistency (Second Incompleteness Theorem)
- "This is called Gödel's incompleteness theorem. To prove his theorems, Gödel used a remarkable extension of the Cantor 'diagonal argument' that I mentioned in Chapter 6. He began by considering any consistent set of rules of inference. Then he showed how to construct a proposition which could neither be proved nor disproved under those rules. Then he proved that that proposition would be true."
##### Errors of Hilbert's program
- "If Hilbert's program had worked, it would have been bad news for the conception of reality that I am promoting in this book, for it would have removed the necessity for understanding in judging mathematical ideas. Anyone - or any mindless machine - that could learn Hilbert's hoped-for rules of inference by heart would be as good a judge of mathematical propositions as the ablest mathematician, yet without needing the mathematician's insight or understanding, or even having the remotest clue as to what the propositions were about. In principle, it would be possible to make new mathematical discoveries without knowing any mathematics at all, beyond Hilbert's rules. One would simply check through all possible strings of letters and mathematical symbols in alphabetical order, until one of them passed the test for being a proof or disproof of some famous unsolved conjecture. In principle, one could settle any mathematical controversy without ever understanding it - without even knowing the meanings of the symbols, let alone understanding how the proof worked, or what it proved, or what the method of proof was, or why it was reliable."
- "It may seem that the achievement of a unified standard of proof in mathematics could at least have helped us in the overall drive towards unification - that is, the 'deepening' of our knowledge that I referred to in Chapter 1. But the opposite is the case. Like the predictive 'theory of everything' in physics, Hilbert's rules would have told us almost nothing about the fabric of reality. They would, as far as mathematics goes, have realized the ultimate reductionist vision, predicting everything (in principle) but explaining nothing."
- "mathematical ideas would have formed a hierarchy, with Hilbert's rules at its root. Mathematical truths whose verification from the rules was very complex would have been objectively less fundamental than those that could be verified immediately from the rules. Since there could have been only a finite supply of such fundamental truths, as time went on mathematics would have had to concern itself with ever less fundamental problems. Mathematics might well have come to an end, under this dismal hypothesis. If it did not, it would inevitably have fragmented into ever more arcane specialities, as the complexity of the 'emergent' issues that mathematicians would have been forced to study increased, and as the connections between those issues and the foundations of the subject became ever more remote."
- "Thanks to Gödel, we know that there will never be a fixed method of determining whether a mathematical proposition is true, any more than there is a fixed way of determining whether a scientific theory is true. Nor will there ever be a fixed way of generating new mathematical knowledge. therefor progress in mathematics will always depend on the exercise of creativity."
##### Role of explanation on abstract and physical world
- "It will always be possible, and necessary, for mathematicians to invent new types of proof. They will validate them by new arguments and by ***new modes of explanation*** depending on their ever improving understanding of the abstract entities involved."
- "Gödel's own theorems were a case in point: to prove them, he had to invent a new method of proof. I said the method was based on the 'diagonal argument', but Gödel extended that argument in a new way. Nothing had ever been proved in this way before; no rules of inference laid down by someone who had never seen Gödel's method could possibly have been prescient enough to designate it as valid. Yet it is self-evidently valid. Where did this self-evidentness come from? It came from Gödel's understanding of the nature of proof. Gödel's proofs are as compelling as any in mathematics, but only if one first understands the explanation that accompanies them."
- "So explanation does, after all, play the same paramount role in pure mathematics as it does in science. Explaining and understanding the world - the physical world and the world of mathematical abstractions - is in both cases the object of the exercise. Proof and observation are merely means by which we check our explanations."
##### Roger Penrose, linking Gödel's theorem to consciousness 
- "Roger Penrose has drawn a further, radical and very Platonic lesson from Gödel's results. Like Plato, Penrose is fascinated by the ability of the human mind to grasp the abstract certainties of mathematics. Unlike Plato, Penrose does not believe in the supernatural, and takes it for granted that the brain is part of, and has access only to, the natural world. So the problem is even more acute for him than it was for Plato: how can the fuzzy, unreliable physical world deliver mathematical certainties to a fuzzy, unreliable part of itself such as a mathematician? In particular, Penrose wonders how we can possibly perceive the infallibility of new, valid *forms of proof*, of which Gödel assures us there is an unlimited supply."
- "but he does claim that the very existence of this sort of open-ended mathematical intuition is fundamentally incompatible with the existing structure of physics, and in particular that it is incompatible with the Turing principle."
- "His argument, in summary, runs as follows. If the Turing principle is true, then we can consider the brain (like any other object) to be a computer executing a particular program. The brain's interactions with the environment constitute the inputs and outputs of the program. Now consider a mathematician in the act of deciding whether some newly proposed type of proof is valid or not. Making such a decision is tantamount to executing a proof-validating computer program within the mathematician's brain. Such a program embodies a set of Hilbertian rules of inference which, according to Gödel's theorem, cannot possibly be complete. Moreover, as I have said, Gödel provides a way of constructing, and proving, a true proposition which those rules can never recognize as proven. Therefore the mathematician, whose mind is effectively a computer applying those rules, can never recognize the proposition as proven either. Penrose then proposes to show the proposition, and Gödel's method of proving it to be true, to that very mathematician. The mathematician understands the proof. It is, after all, self-evidently valid, so the mathematician can presumably see that it is valid. But that would contradict Gödel's theorem. Therefore there must be a false assumption somewhere in the argument, and Penrose thinks that the false assumption is the Turing principle."
- Most computer scientists do not agree with Penrose that the Turing principle is the weakest link in his story. They would say that the mathematician in the story would indeed be unable to recognize the Gödelian proposition as proven. It may seem odd that a mathematician should suddenly become unable to comprehend a self-evident proof.
- "Penrose hopes for a new, fundamental theory o f physics replacing both quantum theory and the general theory of relativity." and to link consciousness to Gödel's theorem.
- "Penrose's world is fundamentally very different from what existing physics describes. Its basic fabric of reality is what we call the world of mathematical abstractions. In this respect Penrose, whose reality includes all mathematical abstractions, but perhaps not all abstractions (like honor and justice), is somewhere between Plato and Pythagoras. What we call the physical world is, to him, fully real (another difference from Plato), but is somehow part of, or emergent from, mathematics itself. Furthermore, there is no universality; in particular, there is no machine that can render all possible human thought processes. Nevertheless, the world (especially, of course, its mathematical substrate) is still comprehensible. Its comprehensibility is ensured not by the universality of computation, but by a phenomenon quite new to physics (though not to Plato): *mathematical entities impinge directly on the human brain*, via physical processes yet to be discovered. In this way the brain, according to Penrose, does not do mathematics solely by reference to what we currently call the physical world. It has direct access to a Platonic reality of mathematical Forms, and can perceive mathematical truths there with (blunders aside) absolute certainty."
- "It is often suggested that the brain may be a quantum computer, and that its intuitions, consciousness and problem-solving abilities might depend on quantum computations. This could be so, but I know of no evidence and no convincing argument that it is so. My bet is that the brain, considered as a computer, is a classical one. But that issue is independent of Penrose's ideas. He is not arguing that the brain is a new sort of universal computer, differing from the universal quantum computer by having a larger repertoire of computations made possible by new, post-quantum physics. He is arguing for a new physics that will not support computational universality, s o that under his new theory i t will not b e possible to construe some of the actions of the brain as computations at all."
##### in a reality composed of physics and understood by the methods of science, where does mathematical certainty come from?
- "even if it is conceded that Penrose's Gödelian argument fails to prove what it sets out to prove, and his proposed new physical theory seems unlikely to explain what it sets out to explain, Penrose is nevertheless right that any world-view based on the existing conception of scientific rationality creates a problem for the accepted foundations of mathematics (or, as Penrose would have it, vice versa)."
- "This is the ancient problem that Plato raised, a problem which, as Penrose points out, becomes more acute in the light of both Gödel's theorem and the Turing principle. It is this: in a reality composed of physics and understood by the methods of science, where does mathematical certainty come from?"
- "While most mathematicians and computer scientists take the certainty of mathematical intuition for granted, they do not take seriously the problem of reconciling this with a scientific worldview."
- "Penrose does take it seriously, and he proposes a solution. His proposal envisages a comprehensible world, rejects the supernatural, recognizes creativity as being central to mathematics, ascribes objective reality both to the physical world and to abstract entities, and involves an integration of the foundations of mathematics and physics. In all those respects I am on his side."
##### What we should want and look for is explanations not certainty.
- "Since Brouwer's, and Hilbert's, and Penrose's and all other attempts to meet Plato's challenge do not seem to have succeeded, it is worth looking again at Plato's apparent demolition of the idea that mathematical truth can be obtained by the methods of science."
- "First of all, Plato tells us that since we have access only to imperfect circles (say) we cannot thereby obtain any knowledge of perfect circles. But why not, exactly? One might as well say that we cannot discover the laws of planetary motion because we do not have access to real planets but only to images of planets. (The Inquisition did say this, and I have explained why they were wrong.)"
- "we can see that this line of criticism depends on a very crude picture of how science works - something like inductivism - which is hardly surprising, since Plato lived before anything that we would recognize as science."
- "If, say, the only way of learning about circles from experience were to examine thousands of physical circles and then, from the accumulated data, to try to infer something about their abstract Euclidean counterparts, Plato would have a point. But if we form a hypothesis that real circles resemble the abstract ones in specified ways, and we happen to be right, then we may well learn something about abstract circles by looking at real ones."
- "In Euclidean geometry one often uses diagrams to specify a geometrical problem or its solution. There is a possibility of error in such a method of description if the imperfections of circles in the diagram give a misleading impression - for example if two circles seem to touch each other when they do not. But if one understands the relationship between real circles and perfect circles, one can, with care, eliminate all such errors. If one does not understand that relationship, it is practically impossible to understand Euclidean geometry at all."
- "The reliability of the knowledge of a perfect circle that one can gain from a diagram of a circle depends entirely on the accuracy of the hypothesis that the two resemble each other in the relevant ways. Such a hypothesis, referring to a physical object (the diagram) , amounts to a physical theory and can never be known with certainty. But that does not, as Plato would have it, preclude the possibility of learning about perfect circles from experience; it just precludes the possibility of certainty. That should not worry anyone who is looking not for certainty but for explanations."
- "Euclidean geometry can be abstractly formulated entirely without diagrams. But the way in which numerals, letters and mathematical symbols are used in a symbolic proof can generate no more certainty than a diagram can, and for the same reason. The symbols too are physical objects - patterns of ink on paper, say - which denote abstract objects. And again, we are relying entirely upon the hypothesis that the physical behavior of the symbols corresponds to the behavior of the abstractions they denote. Therefore the reliability of what we learn by manipulating those symbols depends entirely on the accuracy of our theories of their physical behavior, and of the behavior of our hands, eyes, and so on with which we manipulate and observe the symbols. Trick ink that caused the occasional symbol to change its appearance when we were not looking - perhaps under the remote control of some high technology practical joker - could soon mislead us about what we know 'for certain'."
- "Incidentally, Plato's idea that physical reality consists of imperfect imitations of abstractions seems an unnecessarily asymmetrical stance nowadays. Like Plato, we still study abstractions for their own sake. ***But in post-Galilean science, and in the theory of virtual reality, we also regard abstractions as means of understanding real or artificial physical entities, and in that context we take it for granted that the abstractions are nearly always approximations to the true physical situation***. So, whereas Plato thought of Earthly circles in the sand as approximations to true, mathematical circles, a modern physicist would regard a mathematical circle as a bad approximation to the real shapes of planetary orbits, atoms and other physical things."
##### Rules of inference and proof, explanation.
- "the sum of the angles of any Euclidean triangle is 1 80°. We can measure particular triangles with perfect accuracy in virtual reality, but even in virtual reality we cannot measure all triangles, and so we cannot verify the theorem."
- "How do we verify it? We prove it. A proof is traditionally defined as a sequence of statements satisfying self-evident rules of inference, but what does the 'proving' process amount to physically?"
- "To prove a statement about infinitely many triangles at once, we examine certain physical objects - in this case symbols - which have properties in common with whole classes of triangles. For example, when, under appropriate circumstances, we observe the symbols '$\triangle ABC = \triangle DEF$' (i.e. 'triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF'), we conclude that a whole class of triangles that we have defined in a particular way always have the same shape as corresponding triangles in another class which we have defined differently. The 'appropriate circumstances' that give this conclusion the status of proof are, in physical terms, that the symbols appear on a page underneath other symbols (some of which represent axioms of Euclidean geometry) and that the pattern in which the symbols appear conforms to certain rules, namely the rules of inference."
- "But which rules of inference should we use? This is like asking how we should program the virtual-reality generator to make it render the world of Euclidean geometry. The answer is that we must use rules of inference which, to the best of our understanding, will cause our symbols to behave, in the relevant ways, like the abstract entities they denote. How can we be sure that they will? We cannot. Suppose that some critics object to our rules of inference because they think that our symbols will behave differently from the abstract entities."
- "We cannot appeal to the authority of Aristotle or Plato, nor can we prove that our rules of inference are infallible (quite apart from Gödel's theorem, this would lead to an infinite regress, for we should first have to prove that the method of proof that we used was itself valid). Nor can we haughtily tell the critics that there must be something wrong with their intuition, because our intuition says that the symbols will mimic the abstract entities perfectly. ***All we can do is explain***. We must explain why we think that, under the circumstances, the symbols will behave in the desired way under our proposed rules. And the critics can explain why they favor a rival theory. A disagreement over two such theories is, in part, a disagreement about the observable behavior of physical objects."
- "Such disagreements can be addressed by the normal methods of science. Sometimes they can be readily resolved; sometimes not. Another cause of such a disagreement could be a conceptual clash about the nature of the abstract entities themselves. Then again, it is a matter of rival explanations, this time about abstractions rather than physical objects. Either we could come to a common understanding with our critics, or we could agree that we were discussing two different abstract objects, or we could fail to agree. There are no guarantees. Thus, *contrary to the traditional belief, it is not the case that disputes within mathematics can always be resolved by purely procedural means*."
##### Proof is type computation and computation is physical experiment/process.
- "A conventional symbolic proof seems at first sight to have quite a different character from the 'hands-on' virtual-reality sort of proof. But we see now that they are related in the way that computations are to physical experiments. ***Any physical experiment can be regarded as a computation, and any computation is a physical experiment***. In both sorts of proof, physical entities (whether in virtual reality or not) are manipulated according to rules. In both cases the physical entities represent the abstract entities of interest. And in both cases the reliability of the proof depends on the truth of the theory that physical and abstract entities do indeed share the appropriate properties."
- "We can also see from the above discussion that *proof is a physical process*. In fact, *a proof is a type of computation*. 'Proving' a proposition means performing a computation which, if one has done it correctly, establishes that the proposition is true. When we use the word 'proof ' to denote an object, such as an ink-on-paper text, we mean that the object can be used as a program for recreating a computation of the appropriate kind."
##### There is no royal road to truth
- "It follows that neither the theorems of mathematics, nor the process of mathematical proof, nor the experience of mathematical intuition, confers any certainty. Nothing does."
- "Our mathematical knowledge may, just like our scientific knowledge, be deep and broad, it may be subtle and wonderfully explanatory, it may be uncontroversially accepted; but it cannot be certain."
- "No one can guarantee that a proof that was previously thought to be valid will not one day turn out to contain a profound misconception, made to seem natural by a previously unquestioned 'self-evident' assumption either about the physical world, or about the abstract world, or about the way in which some physical and abstract entities are related."
- "A very similar mis-classification has been caused by the fundamental mistake that mathematicians since antiquity have been making about the very nature of their subject, namely that mathematical knowledge is more certain than any other form of knowledge."
- "Having made that mistake, one has no choice but to classify proof theory as part of mathematics, for a mathematical theorem could not be certain if the theory that justifies its method of proof were itself uncertain."
##### Proof theory is a science
- "But as we have just seen, proof theory is not a branch of mathematics - it is a science. Proofs are not abstract."
- "There is no such thing as abstractly proving something, just as there is no such thing as abstractly calculating or computing something. One can of course define a class of abstract entities and call them 'proofs', but those 'proofs' cannot verify mathematical statements because no one can see them. They cannot persuade anyone of the truth of a proposition, any more than an abstract virtual-reality generator that does not physically exist can persuade people that they are in a different environment, or an abstract computer can factorize a number for us."
- "A mathematical 'theory of proofs' would have no bearing on which mathematical truths can or cannot be proved in reality, just as a theory of abstract 'computation' has no bearing on what mathematicians - or anyone else - can or cannot calculate in reality, unless there is a separate, empirical reason for believing that the abstract 'computations' in the theory resemble real computations."
- "Computations, including the special computations that qualify as proofs, are physical processes. Proof theory is about how to ensure that those processes correctly mimic the abstract entities they are intended to mimic."
##### Quantum computation
- "Once again, we see the inadequacy of the traditional mathematical method of deriving certainty by trying to strip away every possible source of ambiguity or error from our intuitions until only self-evident truth remains. That is what Gödel had done. That is what Church, Post and especially Turing had done when trying to intuit their universal models for computation."
- "Turing hoped that his abstracted-paper-tape model was so simple, so transparent and well defined, that it would not depend on any assumptions about physics that could conceivably be falsified, and therefore that it could become the basis of an abstract theory of computation that was independent of the underlying physics."
- "'He thought,' as Feynman once put it, 'that he understood paper.' But he was mistaken. Real, quantum-mechanical paper is wildly different from the abstract stuff that the Turing machine uses."
- "The Turing machine is entirely classical, and does not allow for the possibility that the paper might have different symbols written on it in different universes, and that those might interfere with one another. Of course, it is impractical to detect interference between different states of a paper tape. But the point is that Turing's intuition, because it included false assumptions from classical physics, caused him to abstract away some of the computational properties of his hypothetical machine, the very properties he intended to keep. That is why the resulting model of computation was incomplete."
##### Conclusion
- "That mathematicians throughout the ages should have made various mistakes about matters of proof and certainty is only natural. The present discussion should lead us to expect that the current view will not last for ever, either. But the confidence with which mathematicians have blundered into these mistakes and their inability to acknowledge even the possibility of error in these matters are, I think, connected with an ancient and widespread confusion between the *methods* of mathematics and its *subject-matter*."
- "Unlike the relationships between physical entities, relationships between abstract entities are independent of any contingent facts and of any laws of physics. They are determined absolutely and objectively by the autonomous properties of the abstract entities themselves. Mathematics, the study of these relationships and properties, is therefore the study of *absolutely necessary truths*. In other words, the truths that mathematics studies are absolutely certain. But that does not mean that our knowledge of those necessary truths is itself certain, nor does it mean that the methods of mathematics confer necessary truth on their conclusions. After all, mathematics also studies falsehoods and paradoxes. And that does not mean that the conclusions of such a study are necessarily false or paradoxical."
- "Necessary truth is merely the *subject-matter* of mathematics, not the reward we get for doing mathematics. The objective of mathematics is not, and cannot be, mathematical certainty. It is not even mathematical truth, certain or otherwise. It is, and must be, mathematical explanation."
- "Why, then, does mathematics work as well as it does? Why does it lead to conclusions which, though not certain, can be accepted and applied unproblematically for millennia at least? Ultimately the reason is that some of our knowledge of the physical world is also that reliable and uncontroversial. And when we understand the physical world sufficiently well, we also understand which physical objects have properties in common with which abstract ones. But in principle the reliability of our knowledge of mathematics remains subsidiary to our knowledge of physical reality. Every mathematical proof depends absolutely for its validity on our being right about the rules that govern the behavior of some physical objects, be they virtual-reality generators, ink and paper, or our own brains."
- "So mathematical intuition is a species of physical intuition. Physical intuition is a set of rules of thumb, some perhaps inborn, many built up in childhood, about how the physical world behaves."
- "Even if any physical or mathematical intuition were inborn, that would not confer any special authority upon it. Inborn intuition cannot be taken as a surrogate for Plato's 'memories' of the world of Forms. For it is a commonplace observation that many of the intuitions built into human beings by accidents of evolution are simply false."
- "The fabric o f reality, then, does have a more unified structure than would have been possible if mathematical knowledge had been verifiable with certainty, and hence hierarchical, as has traditionally been assumed."
- "Mathematical entities are part of the fabric of reality because they are complex and autonomous. The sort of reality they form is in some ways like the realm of abstractions envisaged by Plato or Penrose: although they are by definition intangible, they exist objectively and have properties that are independent of the laws of physics."
- "However, it is physics that allows us to gain knowledge of this realm. And it imposes stringent constraints."
- "Whereas everything in physical reality is comprehensible, the comprehensible mathematical truths are precisely the infinitesimal minority which happen to correspond exactly to some physical truth - like the fact that if certain symbols made of ink on paper are manipulated in certain ways, certain other symbols appear. That is, they are the truths that can be rendered in virtual reality. We have no choice but to assume that the incomprehensible mathematical entities are real too, because they appear inextricably in our explanations of the comprehensible ones."
- "There are physical objects - such as fingers, computers and brains - whose behavior can model that of certain abstract objects. In this way the fabric of physical reality provides us with a window on the world of abstractions. It is a very narrow window and gives us only a limited range of perspectives. Some of the structures that we see out there, such as the natural numbers or the rules of inference of classical logic, seem to be important or 'fundamental' to the abstract world, in the same way as deep laws of nature are fundamental to the physical world. But that could be a misleading appearance. For what we are really seeing is only that some abstract structures are fundamental *to our understanding* of abstractions. We have no reason to suppose that those structures are objectively significant in the abstract world. It is merely that some abstract entities are nearer and more easily visible from our window than others."
##### Terminology
- mathematics: The study of absolutely necessary truths.
- proof: A way of establishing the truth of mathematical propositions.
  - (Traditional definition:) A sequence of statements, starting with some premises and ending with the desired conclusion, and satisfying certain 'rules of inference'.
  - (Better definition:) A computation that models the properties of some abstract entity, and whose outcome establishes that the abstract entity has a given property.
- mathematical intuition: 
  - (Traditionally:) An ultimate, self-evident source of justification for mathematical reasoning.
  - (Actually:) A set of theories (conscious and unconscious) about the behavior of certain physical objects whose behavior models that of interesting abstract entities.
- intuitionism: The doctrine that all reasoning about abstract entities is untrustworthy except where it is based on direct, self-evident intuition. This is the mathematical version of solipsism.
- Hilbert's tenth problem: To 'establish once and for all the certitude of mathematical methods' by finding a set of rules of inference sufficient for all valid proofs, and then proving those rules consistent by their own standards.
- Gödel's incompleteness theorem A proof that Hilbert's tenth problem cannot be solved. For any set of rules of inference, there are valid proofs not designated as valid by those rules.

## David's quotes and notes

- "science is about explaining the seen in terms of unseen" 
  example by Brett:"(explaining the seen) color of certain flames (in terms of the unseen) movements of electrons around the nucleus of an atom"
- "Do not destroy the means of correcting errors"
- "we are right to seek solutions to problems rather than sources of ultimate justification."
- "Problem-solving, after all , is a process that takes place entirely within human minds. ... The fact is that all our problems and solutions are located within ourselves, having been created by ourselves. When we solve problems in science we arrive through argument at theories whose explanations seem best to us."
- "solipsism[can be any other silly theory] is weighed down by additional unnecessary assumptions - worthless baggage, introduced only to be explained away."
- "So, a computation or a proof is a physical process in which objects such as computers or brains physically model or instantiate abstract entities like numbers or equations, and mimic their properties. It is our window on the abstract."
- "The whole motivation for seeking a perfectly secure foundation for mathematics was mistaken. It was a form of justificationism."
- "The object of mathematics is to understand – to explain – abstract entities. Proof is primarily a means of ruling out false explanations; and sometimes it also provides mathematical truths that need to be explained."
- "inductivism rests upon a mistaken idea of science as seeking predictions on the basis of observations, rather than as **seeking explanations in response to problems**."
- " There is no such thing as _instruction_ from without, there is only _conjecture from within_."
- "Everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge."
